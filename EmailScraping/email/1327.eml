Trump invests in the same companies he bashes<http://www.usatoday.com/story=
/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/05/18/trump-invests-same-companies-he-bashes=
/84558700/>
USA TODAY // ELIZA COLLINS

Maybe Donald Trump never learned the phrase "put your money where your mout=
h is." Upon review of his Personal Financial Disclosure<https://www.documen=
tcloud.org/documents/2838696-Trump-2016-Financial-Disclosure.html> it turns=
 out that presumed Republican nominee has invested and profited from multip=
le companies he's slammed on the trail.

Mondelez International

Trump invested in the parent company of Nabisco, which he has has brought u=
p a lot for outsourcing jobs to Mexico<http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2=
016/03/23/nabisco-begins-layoffs-at-chicago-plant-despite-criticism-from-tr=
ump-clinton/82159194/>.

"I'm never eating Oreos again ...  I love Oreos. I will never eat them agai=
n. Nabisco closes the plant in Chicago and they are moving the plant to Mex=
ico." (Fortune<http://fortune.com/2015/08/26/donald-trump-oreos/>, August 2=
015)

Ford

Trump has called the automobile company's decision to build a plant in Mexi=
co an "absolute disgrace" and said it would never happen under a Trump admi=
nistration. At one rally he told supporters he'd call the CEO of Ford and t=
hreaten a 35% tax on any car made in Mexico.


'Let me give you the bad news. Every car, and every truck and every part ma=
nufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charg=
e you a 35% tax. Okay? And that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with=
 the transaction, and that's it.'" (Fortune<(Fortune,%20December%202015)>, =
December 2015)


General Electric



Trump has put money into General Electric. But while campaigning in Connect=
icut, he called General Electric's move of jobs outside the state "devastat=
ing."



"It's so devastating to lose a company like General Electric ... I'm going =
to bring jobs back to Connecticut and to the country. We're not going to le=
t them go to Mexico. ... They're going everywhere but here because we have =
people that don't know how to deal, they don't know how to make deals." (Ha=
rtford Courant<http://www.courant.com/politics/hc-altimari-trump-interview-=
20160415-story.html>, April 2016)

Disney



Trump bashed the company over a lawsuit<http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/25/tec=
hnology/disney-h1b-workers/> that accused them of replacing American worker=
s with foreigners using H1-B visas - and then requiring them to train their=
 replacements. But his anger at the company didn't stop him from investing.



"I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread H-1B abuse a=
nd ending outrageous practices such as those that occurred at Disney in Flo=
rida when Americans were forced to train their foreign replacements. I will=
 end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an=
 absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and imm=
igration program. No exceptions." (Donald J. Trump<https://www.donaldjtrump=
.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-position-on-visas>, March 2016)

Apple



After the technology company refused to unlock the phones of the shooters i=
n the San Bernardino massacre, Trump called on his supporters to ban Apple =
products. Yet, his financial disclosures show he invested in Apple.



"I like the idea of a boycott of Apple until such time as they give that in=
formation." (Politico<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/donald-trump-ap=
ple-boycott-219507>, February 2016)

United Technologies Corporation



Trump also invested in the parent company to Carrier Corp., an Indiana-base=
d air-conditioning manufacturer that is in the process of outsourcing thous=
ands of jobs<http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/02/10/carrier-move-in=
dy-unit-mexico-eliminate-1400-jobs/80181804/> to Mexico. In an interview wi=
th Breitbart News after Carrier's announcement, Trump spoke broadly about t=
he need to lower taxes.



"First of all, you're going to have to look to lower taxes [for those who d=
o business inside the United States] - and we may very well have to charge =
taxes at the border, when somebody drives a car through the border to sell =
it in the United States. But look, we've closed our plants. We've lost our =
jobs. They're not going to build cars in Mexico and sell them in the United=
 States, OK? We can lower our taxes, and we're probably going to have to ch=
arge a surtax at the border. Otherwise we're going to lose a fortune. And t=
hat will help Ford and other people make a decision to buy in the United St=
ates, to build in the United States." (Breitbart News<http://www.breitbart.=
com/big-government/2016/02/12/exclusive-donald-trump-on-ford-carrier-shippi=
ng-jobs-to-mexico-im-the-only-one-who-understands-whats-going-on/>, Februar=
y 2016)



The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to request for comment.
