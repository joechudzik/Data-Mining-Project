Daniel --

It's National Reentry Week, a time when we shed a light on
the resources needed to help those who were formerly
incarcerated get another shot to join their communities in a
positive way. In America, we believe in second chances --
that even if you make a mistake that lands you jail, if you
serve your time, you can still earn a second chance at the
American Dream.

At least, that's the way it's supposed to work. But our
criminal justice system is broken. Every year, more than
600,000 Americans get released from prison ready to make a
new start, only to be met with often insurmountable
obstacles. Getting a job, finding affordable, housing,=20
and getting access to both health care and education=20
are all significantly harder. For too many, the system=20
is rigged to fail.

Add your name to the fight to reform America's broken
criminal justice system:

https://my.barackobama.com/Stand-For-Criminal-Justice-Reform

Our system is not supposed to make it easier to revert back
to criminal behavior than to become a productive member of
society, but it often does. Preventing relapses into
crime is one of the most fundamental priorities of criminal
justice, but with the system set up as it is today, too many
Americans end up trapped in a cruel cycle of poverty and
crime that weakens our communities.

That's why President Obama's administration has consistently
taken steps to make our system fairer, smarter, less
expensive, and more effective. From reducing barriers to
employment, to increasing access to education for
formerly-incarcerated individuals, the President continues
to do what he can, where he can. But that's not going to be
enough.

Some members of Congress have already been working on the
issue, but if we're going to break down the very real
barriers that stand in the way of citizens returning to
society to become positive members of their communities, we
need more of their colleagues to come to the table and pass
a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill.

Join OFA supporters all over the country to call for a
criminal justice system that lives up to our values. Add
your name to be a part of this fight:
