In case Cruz endorses or starts talking nice about Trump, below is a compilation of his harshest attacks against Trump.  Thanks to Eric for helping pull these together.

Cruz: "I'm Going To Tell You What I Really Think Of Donald Trump.  This Man Is A Pathological Liar.  He Doesn't Know The Difference Between Truth And Lies.  He Lies, Practically Every Word That Comes Out Of His Mouth...The Man Cannot Tell The Truth, But He Combines It With Being A Narcissist.  A Narcissist At A Level I Don't Think This Country Has Ever Seen."  CRUZ: "I'm going to tell you what I really think of Donald Trump. This man is a pathological liar. He doesn't know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth. And in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying. He accuses everybody on that debate stage of lying. And it's simply a mindless yell. Whatever he does, he accuses everyone else of doing. The man cannot tell the truth, but he combines it with being a narcissist. A narcissist at a level I don't think this country has ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and goes, dude, what's your problem? Everything in Donald's world is about Donald. And he combines being a pathological liar, and I say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory and he'd pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever lie he's telling, at that minute he believes it." [Cruz Press Gaggle in Evansville, IN, 5/3/16]



Cruz On Trump:  "The Man Is Utterly Amoral.  Morality Does Not Exist For Him."  CRUZ: "The man is utterly amoral." QUESTION: "Senator - "  CRUZ: "Let me finish this, please. The man is utterly amoral. Morality does not exist for him.  It's why he went after Heidi directly and smeared my wife, attacked her. Apparently she's not pretty enough for Donald Trump. I may be biased, but I think if he's making that allegation, he's also legally blind. But Donald is a bully. You know, we just visited with fifth graders. Every one of us knew bullies in elementary school. Bullies don't come from strength, bullies come from weakness. Bullies come from a deep, yawning cavern of insecurity. There is a reason Donald builds giant buildings and puts his name on them everywhere he goes." [Cruz Press Gaggle in Evansville, IN, 5/3/16]



Cruz:  Trump "Is Lying To His Supporters.  Donald Will Betray His Supporters On Every Issue." CRUZ: "And I will say there are millions of people in this country who are angry. They're angry at Washington, they're angry at politicians who have lied to them. I understand that anger. I share that anger. And Donald is cynically exploiting that anger, and he is lying to his supporters. Donald will betray his supporters on every issue. If you care about immigration, Donald is laughing at you. And he's telling the moneyed elites he doesn't believe what he's saying. He's not going to build a wall. That's what he told 'The New York Times.' He will betray you on ever you issue across the board. And his strategy of being a bully in particular is directed at women. Donald has a real problem with women. People who are insecure, people who are insecure about who they are." [Cruz Press Gaggle in Evansville, IN, 5/3/16]

Cruz On Trump: "As The Father Of Two Young Girls, The Idea Of Our Daughters Coming Home And Repeating Any Word That Man Says Horrifies Me.  That Is Not Who America Is...It Is Only The Good Sense And Judgment Of Indiana That Can Pull Us Back.  We Are Staring At The Abyss."  CRUZ: "The president of the United States has a bully pulpit unlike anybody else. The president of the United States affects our culture. I ask the people of Indiana, think about the next five years if this man were to become president. Think about the next five years, the boasting, the pathological lying, the picking up the 'National Enquirer' and accusing people of killing JFK. The bullying. Think about your kids coming back and emulating this. For people in Indiana who long for a day when we were nice to each other, when we treated people with respect, when we didn't engage in sleaze and lies, and I would note one of the lies he engages in, listen, Donald Trump is a serial philanderer and he boasts about it.  This is not a secret.  He's proud of being a serial philanderer. I want everyone to think about your teen age kids. The president of the United States talks about how great it is to commit adultery, describes his battle with venereal disease as his own personal Vietnam. That's a quote by the way on the Howard Stern Show.  Do you want to spend the next five years with your kids bragging about infidelity? He does the same projection, just like a pathological liar. He accuses everyone about lying. Even though he boasts about it, he plants a lie about me and my family, attacking my family. He accuses others of doing what he is doing. I'll tell you, as the father of two young girls, the idea of our daughters coming home and repeating any word that man says horrifies me. That is not who America is. And I would say to the Hoosier state, the entire country is depending on you. The entire country is looking to you right now. It is only Indiana that can pull us back. It is only the good sense and good judgment of Indiana that can pull us back. We are staring at the abyss." [Cruz Press Gaggle in Evansville, IN, 5/3/16]

Responding To Trump's Attacks On His Wife, Cruz Said: "Donald, You're A Sniveling Coward And Leave Heidi The Hell Alone." "An angry and emotional Ted Cruz on Thursday ripped into Donald Trump for his attacks on Cruz's wife, Heidi, and repeatedly declined to say whether he would support Trump if he's the Republican presidential nominee. 'Donald, you're a sniveling coward and leave Heidi the hell alone,' Cruz told reporters after a factory tour in Dane, Wisconsin, pointing his finger at the cameras for emphasis." [CNN, 3/24/16<http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/24/politics/ted-cruz-donald-trump-heidi-cruz-hell-alone/index.html>]



Cruz: "Donald's Campaign, His Entire Campaign Is Built On A Lie." CRUZ: And, you know, I will say this, Donald's campaign, his entire campaign is built on a lie. I understand the people who are supporting him. BLITZER: "What's the lie?" CRUZ: "Well, let me explain. I understand the people who are supporting Donald. They are frustrated with Washington, with politicians in both parties that have been lying to us, that make promises and they go to Washington and they do the exact opposite of what they said. But if you are fed up with Washington, with the corruption of Washington, then it doesn't make any sense to support Donald Trump who has been enmeshed in the corruption of Washington. The lie behind Donald's campaign is that he will stand up to Washington. He is the system." [AC 360, CNN, 3/21/16]



Cruz On Whether He Would Support Trump As The Nominee: "I'm Not In The Habit Of Supporting People Who Attack My Wife And Attack My Family." "Ted Cruz for a third time would not say that he would support Donald Trump as the GOP presidential nominee, the latest sign that his pledge to do so may be softening. Cruz late last week began signaling that his unconditional support for the Republican front-runner was not as ironclad as previously. But asked by CNN's Sunlen Serfaty on Monday if he would definitively say that he would not support Trump, the Texas senator left his answer ambiguous. 'I'm not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my family,' Cruz said. 'Donald Trump is not gonna be the nominee. We are gonna beat him for this nomination.' Pressed why he would not come out and say that Trump wouldn't have his support in a general election -- which some of his female supporters have said -- Cruz continued to evade a direct answer. 'What I am saying is we are going to beat Donald Trump for the nomination. We are seeing Republicans uniting,' he said. 'The best way to prevent Donald Trump from being the nominee is beat him at the ballot box, and that's what we are doing right now.'" [CNN, 3/29/16<http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/28/politics/ted-cruz-donald-trump-support/index.html>; VIDEO]



Cruz: "Donald Trump's Consistently Disgraceful Behavior Is Beneath The Office We Are Seeking."  "I want to be crystal clear: these attacks are garbage. For Donald J. Trump  o enlist his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding shows you that there is no low Donald won't go.  These smears are completely false, they're offensive to Heidi and me, they're offensive to our daughters, and they're offensive to everyone Donald continues to personally attack. Donald Trump's consistently disgraceful behavior is beneath the office we are seeking and we are not going to follow."  [Ted Cruz, Facebook, 3/25/16<https://www.facebook.com/tedcruzpage/posts/10153999687717464>]



Cruz: "Donald Has Had A Long Career Of Using Great Wealth And Power Trying To Bully Others." "CRUZ: Donald has had a long career of using great wealth and power trying to bully others. Whenever anyone points to their actual record, the response of both Donald Trump and Marco Rubio is to yell the word liar. Whenever anyone does, as this ad does, plays the actual words of Donald Trump on national television, his response is to yell liar. Their strategy is simply to yell liar, liar, liar." [Meet The Press, NBC, 2/21/16]



Cruz: "Every Deal Donald Does ... The People That Get Hammered Are The Working Men And Women. He Gets Rich, And Everyone Else Gets Left Holding The Bag." CRUZ: "Look, every deal Donald does, whether it's Vera Coking with eminent domain or whether it is using illegal immigrants to build Trump Tower, the people that get hammered are the working men and women. He gets rich, and everyone else gets left holding the bag, and the difference, I believe, between me and the other people on that stage is, when I say something, I'm going to do exactly what I say, and we are going to secure the borders, and we are going to end the illegal immigration." [National Religious Broadcaster Convention, 2/26/16]



Cruz Said Trump "Has Been Intricately Involved In The Corruption In Washington For 40 Years." CRUZ: You know, actions speak louder than words. And Donald has also told us that he will be someone totally different as president. He said he can be the most politically correct person on earth. You know what? Let me talk to a minute - talk for a minute to the folks who are supporting Donald. I understand why people are supporting Donald. You are angry. Look, I'm angry. We are all angry. We are angry at Washington. We're angry at politicians who lie to us. Who lie to us over and over again. They make promises and they don't do what they said they would do. And I understand if you're angry that Trump is the loudest, angriest voice so that feels like a vessel to express that anger. But Donald has, number one, been intricately involved in the corruption in Washington for 40 years." [Kelly File, Fox News, 3/9/16]



Cruz: "Listen, Particularly On Foreign Policy, Donald Is Out Of His Depth, He Doesn't Know. He Doesn't Understand These Issues." CRUZ: "And sadly, what Donald has done, when he gets scared -- listen, particularly on foreign policy, Donald is out of his depth, he doesn't know. He doesn't understand these issues. One of the reasons he was so scared this week is this past week, Donald called publicly for effectively withdrawing America from NATO. Now that is a catastrophically foolish proposition. Abandoning Europe, withdrawing from the most successful military alliance of modern times makes no sense at all. If Donald were president, he actually did what he said he would do, withdraw from NATO, it would hand a massive victory to Putin, a massive victory to ISIS. ISIS would be dancing in the street at the weakness and isolationism of Donald Trump. Now the day after he calls for withdrawing from NATO, this Brussels terror attack occurs. Brussels, is, of course, where NATO is headquartered. And so his lack of understanding on foreign policy, his lack of ability and readiness to protect his country was evident. And so Donald did what he always does, he tried to find a way to change the subject. He hasn't campaigned for a week. He's been hiding in Trump Tower. But late at night he sends tweets attacking my wife, attacking Heidi. It is inappropriate. It is wrong. It is, frankly, disgusting to see a candidate attacking the spouse of another. And it is a sign of just how scared Donald is right now because he doesn't want to discuss the substance." [Fox News Sunday, Fox News, 3/27/16]

<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b>Cruz On Whether He Would Support Trump As The Nominee: &#8220;I&#8217;m Not In The Habit Of Supporting People Who Attack My Wife And Attack My Family.&#8221;
</b>&#8220;Ted Cruz for a third time would not say that he would support Donald Trump as the GOP presidential nominee, the latest sign that his pledge to do so may be softening. Cruz late last week began signaling that his unconditional support for the Republican
 front-runner was not as ironclad as previously. But asked by CNN's Sunlen Serfaty on Monday if he would definitively say that he would not support Trump, the Texas senator left his answer ambiguous. &#8216;I'm not in the habit of supporting people who attack my
 wife and attack my family,&#8217; Cruz said. &#8216;Donald Trump is not gonna be the nominee. We are gonna beat him for this nomination.&#8217; Pressed why he would not come out and say that Trump wouldn't have his support in a general election -- which some of his female supporters
 have said -- Cruz continued to evade a direct answer. &#8216;What I am saying is we are going to beat Donald Trump for the nomination. We are seeing Republicans uniting,&#8217; he said. &#8216;The best way to prevent Donald Trump from being the nominee is beat him at the ballot
 box, and that's what we are doing right now.&#8217;&#8221; [CNN, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/28/politics/ted-cruz-donald-trump-support/index.html">

 us. Who lie to us over and over again. They make promises and they don't do what they said they would do. And I understand if you're angry that Trump is the loudest, angriest voice so that feels like a vessel to express that anger. But Donald has, number one,

<p class="MsoNormalCxSpLast"><b>Cruz: &#8220;Listen, Particularly On Foreign Policy, Donald Is Out Of His Depth, He Doesn't Know. He Doesn't Understand These Issues.&#8221;
</b>CRUZ: &#8220;And sadly, what Donald has done, when he gets scared -- listen, particularly on foreign policy, Donald is out of his depth, he doesn't know. He doesn't understand these issues. One of the reasons he was so scared this week is this past week, Donald
 called publicly for effectively withdrawing America from NATO. Now that is a catastrophically foolish proposition. Abandoning Europe, withdrawing from the most successful military alliance of modern times makes no sense at all. If Donald were president, he
 actually did what he said he would do, withdraw from NATO, it would hand a massive victory to Putin, a massive victory to ISIS. ISIS would be dancing in the street at the weakness and isolationism of Donald Trump. Now the day after he calls for withdrawing
 from NATO, this Brussels terror attack occurs. Brussels, is, of course, where NATO is headquartered. And so his lack of understanding on foreign policy, his lack of ability and readiness to protect his country was evident. And so Donald did what he always
 does, he tried to find a way to change the subject. He hasn't campaigned for a week. He's been hiding in Trump Tower. But late at night he sends tweets attacking my wife, attacking Heidi. It is inappropriate. It is wrong. It is, frankly, disgusting to see
 a candidate attacking the spouse of another. And it is a sign of just how scared Donald is right now because he doesn't want to discuss the substance.&#8221; [Fox News Sunday, Fox News, 3/27/16]<o:p></o:p></p>
