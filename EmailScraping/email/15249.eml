Michelle -

You are such a rock star - we are so lucky to have you. Unfortunately we didn't get any slots for the Cinco de Mayo event this year, I am terribly sorry but I promise to keep you top of mind for whatever it is they send me down the pike. Again, my profuse apologies. I hope this at least, if nothing else, means you'll get some rest! 

My best,
Zach

Hello Zach,
I am actually campaigning in Philadelphia today and tomorrow. Then I am off to NYC until the 30th. I won't be having access to my mailbox until the 1st. Please email me if I am receiving an invitation to the White House Cinco de Mayo event.

Thanks,
Michelle Daniels

I almost missed my White House Cinco de Mayo invitation last year, because it went to my other address. My other address 219 West Ave, is my billing address (please keep it for my future donations). This month I will be physically at the Spencerport Rd. address if you are sending an invitation.
