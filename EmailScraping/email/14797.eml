Subject: Travel pool report #7

Motorcade left the convention center at 3:36pm and arrived at the preside=
ntial palace at 3:40pm for President Obama's meeting with Prime MinisterN=
guyen Xuan Phuc.

The US and Vietnamese delegations were seated across from each other arou=
nd a large oval-shaped cherry wood table.

The prime minister spoke first. As interpreted, he started by welcoming P=
OTUS, said it was a pleasure to receive him. He said this is an historic =
visit, opens new chapter in relations between US and Vietnam. He said he =
was informed  that POTUS had productive talks with President Quang. He sa=
id he is delighted and feels encouraged by strengthened economic ties, wh=
ich he said will promote economic growth in Vietnam.

POTUS spoke next but pool did not hear a lot of what he said because once=
 he started speaking, Vietnamese officials started telling US press we ha=
d to leave and were being aggressive. We stayed but missed much of what P=
OTUS said because of the back and forthright.

POTUS said across the spectrum of issues - from economy to maritime issue=
s, US-Vietnamcooperation continues to expand. He said he was looking forw=
ard to a productive meeting.

Pool was then ushered out and is holding.
