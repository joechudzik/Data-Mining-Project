Subject: COMMS REVIEW: The =93King of Debt=94 and Congressional Republicans=
 on the Economy

SL: The =93King of Debt,=94 Donald Trump and the GOP on the Economy

In less than a week since becoming the GOP=92s presumptive nominee, Donald =
Trump has already exposed himself as reckless and dangerous on the American=
 economy. His comments over the last few days promise to undermine  the rol=
e of the United States as a major economic power and potentially threaten t=
he global financial system.

On Taxes, Trump Can=92t Hide from GOP=92s Obsession with Trickle Down Econo=
mics =96 Yesterday, Trump tried to dismiss concerns about his reckless tax =
plan, which would reward those at the top<http://www.reuters.com/article/us=
-usa-election-trump-idUSKCN0XZ0I3> by slashing the top income tax rate to 2=
5 percent from 39.6 percent, claiming that =93the rich=94 are =93probably g=
oing to end up paying more.=94 In reality, such a move would give<http://ww=
w.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/first-read-why-trump-s-flip-flop-taxes-ma=
tters-n570431> the =93top 0.1% of income earners like himself an average ta=
x cut of more than $1.3 million (versus $2,700 for those in the middle clas=
s).=94 Trump also plans to substantially<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/posit=
ions/tax-reform> reduce the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, even beyond t=
he reckless plan put forth by Republican Speaker Paul Ryan.
This latest effort to mask Try as he might, Trump can=92t hide the facts ab=
out his the Republican party=92s reckless economic policies, which are the =
same policies that preceded the great recession when our economy was losing=
 800,000 jobs per month.
Trump=92s plans are nearly identical to the proposal put forth by Paul Ryan=
 and Republicans in Congress who want to cut<http://www.taxjusticeblog.org/=
archive/2015/10/paul_ryan_wants_to_cut_taxes_f.php#.VzCi6oQrK70> the top ta=
x rate to 25 percent. Ryan would also cut corporate taxes down to 25 percen=
t. There=92s a name for this: Trickle Down Economics. And it doesn=92t work=
. Just ask the last two Republican Adminsitrations, which both left our cou=
ntry mired in recession and facing massive deficits.

On America=92s Debt: A Page Out of the GOP Playbook =96 This morning, Trump=
 doubled down on his statements that the United States should consider<http=
://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-no-debt-default-222957#ixzz48AeHAol=
A> playing fast and loose with our nation=92s finances, even calling himsel=
f . He noted this morning that he=92s =93the king of debt.=94 He also said,=
 =93this is the United States government. First of all, you never have to d=
efault because you print the money.=94 Such reckless positions, if implemen=
ted, could threaten America=92s standing in the world and lead to chaos in =
the financial markets.

This is the same sort of behavior that Republicans in Congress undertook wh=
en they played politics last year with the debt ceiling (this was not the f=
irst time), leading one credit rating agency to remark<http://www.latimes.c=
om/business/la-fi-government-shutdown-credit-rating-fitch-20150923-story.ht=
ml> that any protracted fight over the issue could endanger America=92s cre=
dit rating.

=93Donald Trump=92s reckless tax policies and his suggestion that we should=
 play chicken with the country=92s finances are lifted directly from the sa=
me old failed Congressional Republican playbook. Trump can try to run from =
ignore reality and crown himself the king of debt, but his positions but hi=
s record economic ideas, and those of his fellow Republican leaders is clea=
r are as bankrupt as the Trump Taj Mahal was in 1991, and the Trump Plaza H=
otel in 1992, and Trump Hotels in 2004, and Trump Entertainment Resorts in =
2009. America cannot afford a disastrous Trump presidency. Now more than ev=
er we need to elect a Democrat as our 45th president.=94      [-XXX]
