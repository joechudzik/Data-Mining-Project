It depends on how fancy you want to go. We can go the super fancy route where you got a handwritten note, which Jordan can try to arrange (he'd probably do it at the DC Roundtable or in NYC on 6/8), OR you could go the more subdued route and get a typed letter with an autopen signature. That will go through Amy's office.

Possible to get her a letter from POTUS congratulating her on her James Beard award? How does that work?
