Looks like another Washington establishment figure is ready to rally around=
 Trump! It makes perfect sense - Boehner's obstruction of progress and inab=
ility to rein in the most extreme voices in his party laid the groundwork f=
or the GOP's natural frontrunner and his "texting buddy," Donald Trump.



Former Speaker Boehner Calls Cruz 'Lucifer in the Flesh'<http://www.nbcnews=
.com/politics/2016-election/former-speaker-boehner-calls-cruz-lucifer-flesh=
-n564081>

NBC NEWS // CARRIE DANN



John Boehner is not a big fan of Ted Cruz.



So much so, in fact, that the former Republican House Speaker told an audie=
nce at Stanford University Wednesday that the Texas senator is "Lucifer in =
the flesh" and a "miserable son of a bitch."



Asked about the 2016 presidential candidate at a forum hosted by Stanford i=
n Government (SIG) and the Stanford Speakers Bureau, Boehner drew laughter =
for making a face of disgust, according to the Stanford Daily.<http://www.s=
tanforddaily.com/2016/04/28/john-boehner-talks-election-time-in-office/>



"Lucifer in the flesh," Boehner said, according to the paper. "I have Democ=
rat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I=
 have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life."



He added that he would vote for Donald Trump in a general election if he be=
comes the Republican nominee but that he would not vote for Cruz.



Boehner was reportedly urged by the event's moderator, Professor David M. K=
ennedy, to be frank because the event was not being broadcast.



The former Ohio lawmaker had kinder words for his "texting buddy" Donald Tr=
ump, with whom Boehner has played golf with for "years."



And he described another 2016 candidate, John Kasich, as a "friend" too, al=
though he suggested that the relationship takes "more effort" than others.



"[Kasich] requires more effort on my behalf than all my other friends ... b=
ut he's still my friend, and I love him," Boehner said.



Cruz famously led a group of hard-line conservatives who derailed House lea=
ders' attempts to avoid a government shutdown in 2013. Cruz's failed attemp=
t to force the defunding of President Barack Obama's signature health care =
law resulted in a 16-day shutdown that was widely seen as politically damag=
ing for the Republican Party.



Boehner stepped down from his role as House Speaker last September under po=
litical pressure from conservatives on Capitol Hill.



NBC News has reached out to Cruz's team for comment.
