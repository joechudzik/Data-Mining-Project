Importance: High

What is the speaking order? I would like to create a briefing report like I=
 did for my rights restoration call last week; a copy is attached.

Rep. Pete Aguilar

Thank you for joining this call today. This issue is very personal to me gi=
ven that San Bernardino, California is a part of my district. I left the Ho=
use floor after the first votes that after the December 2, 2015, shooting t=
o return to the district. No one ever thinks something like that will happe=
n so close to home. Yet it did.

We have held so many moments of silence for those lost to gun violence. We =
have prayed for their families, and we have vowed to take steps so that thi=
s would never happen again. Our words are empty if our actions don=92t back=
 them up.

No single reform could have stopped the tragedy that unfolded in San Bernar=
dino, but that=92s not an excuse to ignore the need for a national discussi=
on around gun safety.

The National Rifle Association is the most powerful gun lobby in the nation=
, and they have tried to shut down any attempts at sensible gun safety meas=
ures, even though a majority of their members think it=92s time to have ref=
orms like universal background checks for all gun purchases. Despite the re=
cent spate of mass shootings and terror fears, the NRA and their Republican=
 friends in Congress even opposed a measure to bar suspected terrorists fro=
m buying guns.

Not too long ago, Donald Trump criticized Republican officials who =93walk =
the NRA line and refuse even limited restrictions.=94 Today, he=92s singing=
 the praises of the Second Amendment as =93a bedrock natural right.=94 Trum=
p=92s also pushed the real estate industry, as a group, to hire NRA lobbyis=
ts even though he claimed many of the NRA=92s positions were indefensible.

I don=92t know how officials at the NRA or the Republican Party sleep at ni=
ght, knowing that we can and should do more to protect our communities. The=
re=92s an emptiness to our unanswered prayers for change when we don=92t ta=
ke steps to work for the type of change that we want. I don=92t want to hol=
d another moment of silence =96 I want Congress to toward a sensible soluti=
on and I want the Republican Party to realize that they answer to the Ameri=
can public, not the NRA.

Rep. Elizabeth Esty

Hi everyone, thank you for joining us on the call and thank you to the othe=
r speakers for your attention to this issue.

Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut is in my district. I a=
m sickened and horrified that in the three-and-a-half years since those sho=
otings, nothing has been done on gun reform. I lay the blame on the NRA and=
 the Members of Congress who are beholden to them.

Despite the fact that 90 percent of Americans supported action on gun refor=
m after Newtown tragedy, the NRA and their allies worked to defeat the bill=
 by spreading rumors and falsehoods. Meanwhile, news of shootings across th=
e country dominate the headlines.

Both of our Democratic presidential candidates have proposed solutions to a=
ddress this crisis, and President Obama=92s executive actions earlier this =
year addresses this crisis with expanding background checks, better enforci=
ng laws already on the books, increasing mental health treatment, and fundi=
ng research for gun safety technology.

Meanwhile the NRA is advocating for further deregulation of firearms, and t=
hey have found a willing audience in the Republican Party.

We=92ve seen this play out over and over again over the years. With the hel=
p of the Republican Party, the NRA defeated a bill to extend a ban on assau=
lt weapons, blocked a bill that would have extended background checks to gu=
ns shows, and passed dangerous =93stand your ground=94 laws in 23 states, i=
ncluding Kentucky.

The NRA and their legislative allies are making our country less safe. It i=
s unconscionable that Donald Trump and top Republican leaders like Paul Rya=
n and Mitch McConnell continue to indulge this radical organization.

The NRA and its extreme, uncompromising leadership have blocked reasonable =
reforms to reduce gun violence. As a vice chair of the U.S. House Gun Viole=
nce Prevention Task Force, I am a strong advocate for commonsense gun refor=
ms in Congress. We cannot allow the NRA to control the White House come Nov=
ember, and we need to block their influence in Congress.

I am urging the media on this call and voters to hold these people accounta=
ble. We can=92t cross our fingers and hope against hope for an end to gun v=
iolence. We need to make it happen.
