REMARKS BY PRESIDENT OBAMA

IN DISCUSSION AT BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP EVENT

=A0

DreamPlex

Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam

=A0

=A0

5:20 P.M. ICT

=A0

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 Thank you.=A0 Zin ch=E0o.=A0 (Applause.)=
=A0 Thank you very much.=A0 Thank you.=A0 Well, it=92s wonderful to be he=
re in Ho Chi Minh City.=A0 Please have a seat.=A0=A0=20

=A0

I just had the opportunity to visit the Jade Emperor Pagoda. And I think =
going from a 100-year-old sacred temple to this 21st century Dreamplex is=
 I think a wonderful expression of the evolution that's taken place here =
in Vietnam -- a country that honors its history, but is also boldly racin=
g towards the future.=A0=20

And that=92s also the story of this city.=A0 This is a city on the move.=A0=
 And we could see as we were traveling in from the airport all the activi=
ty that's currently taking place.=A0 And I=92m not just talking about the=
 traffic -- (laughter) -- although I do think it might be easier to be on=
 a motorbike than a motorcade.=A0 (Laughter.)

=A0

But this city, like this country, is full of energy.=A0 You can see it in=
 the skyscrapers shooting above the horizon and the shops that are spring=
ing up at every corner.=A0 You can spot it online, where tens of millions=
 of Vietnamese are connecting with each other and with the world.=A0 And =
you can feel it here at DreamPlex, where ideas are becoming a reality.=A0=
 I just had the chance to see some of those ideas in action -- young peop=
le who are making things happen.=A0 I saw a virtual game that can help pe=
ople recover from nerve injuries, to a machine that lets your smartphone =
control a laser-cutter -- although you have to be careful with the laser-=
cutter where you point it.=A0 (Laughter.)=A0=A0=20

=A0

But some of this energy may be due to your famous c=E0 ph=EA tr=FAng.=A0 =
That stuff is strong, I understand.=A0 But the real driver of Vietnam=92s=
 growth, and the engine of Ho Chi Minh City, is the spirit of entrepreneu=
rship -- the spirit that brings us here today.=A0=20

=A0

And I see it everywhere I travel all around the world.=A0 I meet people -=
- and especially young people, like the three that we're about to meet --=
 who are eager to strike out on their own, start something new, and shape=
 their own destinies.=A0 Many want to do more than just create a great ne=
w appropriate for a phone.=A0 They want to contribute to their communitie=
s and help people live better lives.=A0=20

=A0

And that=92s what entrepreneurship is all about.=A0 It's building busines=
ses -- making a profit, hopefully.=A0 But it's also about creating good j=
obs, and developing new products, and devising ways to serve others.=A0 E=
ntrepreneurship is also the fuel for prosperity that puts rising economie=
s on the path to success. It=92s what gives young people like so many of =
you the chance to channel your energy and your passion into something tha=
t is bigger than yourselves.=A0 And it allows us to come together across =
countries and cultures to solve some of the world=92s greatest challenges=
.=A0=20

=A0

Of course, being an entrepreneur is not easy.=A0 It=92s not easy in the U=
nited States; it's not easy here in Vietnam; it's not easy anyplace in th=
e world.=A0 It can be tough to get started.=A0 It=92s hard to access capi=
tal.=A0 It's hard to get the skills that you need to run a business.=A0 Y=
ou might not always have the mentors and the networks that can help guide=
 you along the way.=A0 And it can be especially difficult for women, for =
others who traditionally are not viewed as being at the center of busines=
s life in a country, haven't had all the access to the same opportunities=
.=A0=20

=A0

So we=92ve got to tap all the talent that's out there.=A0 Just because yo=
u are born poor does not mean you should not be able to start a business.=
=A0 Just because you don't look like the traditional businessman doesn=92=
t mean you can't make a great product or deliver a great service.=A0=20

=A0

And that=92s why DreamPlex is so important.=A0 It=92s not only a home for=
 digital entrepreneurs like you.=A0 It=92s also a place where you can sha=
re ideas and work together and build a community that supports each other=
.=A0=20

=A0

And incubators like this allow Vietnam, alongside its emphasis on entrepr=
eneurship, to see more startups happening in this country than ever befor=
e.=A0 Recently, in one year alone, the funding for startups doubled in th=
is country.=A0 And we=92re seeing major acquisitions, like Fossil Group=92=
s takeover Misfit Wearables, a Vietnamese company that makes devices like=
 fitness trackers.=A0 We=92re seeing Vietnamese-Americans who are coming =
here to start new ventures -- and that shows a strong bond between the Un=
ited States and Vietnam.

=A0

And the world is taking notice.=A0 A leading global venture capital firm =
called 500 Startups just launched a $10 million fund here in Ho Chi Minh =
City.=A0 Next month at our Global Entrepreneurship Summit -- something th=
at I've been hosting now for several years -- I=92ll welcome eight Vietna=
mese entrepreneurs to Silicon Valley, so that they can learn from some of=
 the best entrepreneurs and startups and venture capitalists in the world=
. And your success sends a message to global investors about this country=
=92s incredible potential for innovation.=A0 Hopefully it also encourages=
 other Vietnamese entrepreneurs to chase that new great idea and start th=
at new company, which will continue to fuel an ever-expanding Vietnam eco=
nomy.

=A0

I=92m here today because the United States is committed to being a partne=
r as you grow.=A0 With the Peace Corps coming to Vietnam for the first ti=
me, our volunteers are going to help more Vietnamese learn English -- the=
 language that so often is used in the global economy.=A0 With programs l=
ike our Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative, we=92re helping give th=
ousands of young people across Vietnam the skills and networks they need =
to turn their ideas into action.=A0 With our U.S.-ASEAN Connect Initiativ=
e, we=92re matching American investors with Vietnamese entrepreneurs in a=
reas like clean energy.=A0 With the women=92s entrepreneurship center we=92=
re going to open here in Vietnam -- WECREATE is what we're going to call =
it -- we=92ll help empower the next generation of women business owners.=A0=
=20

=A0

And if we really want to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, I sho=
uld mention that we need to move ahead with the Trans-Pacific Partnership=
, because TPP will not only let us sell more of our goods to each other a=
nd bring our economies closer together, it will accelerate economic refor=
ms here in Vietnam, boost your economic competitiveness, open up new mark=
ets not only for large companies but also for small and medium-sized busi=
nesses.=A0 It will raise labor and environmental standards, and it will i=
mprove business conditions so that entrepreneurs like you can thrive.=A0=20=


=A0

So my message to all the entrepreneurs here today is that I believe in yo=
u, America believes in you, and we=92re going to keep investing in your s=
uccess.=A0 Ultimately, it=92s the inventors and dreamers, people like tho=
se that I just met, those that we'll hear from soon, and all of you in th=
e audience who are going to shape Vietnam=92s future for decades to come.=
=A0=20

=A0

So I'm looking forward to hearing from these outstanding young leaders.=A0=
 Thank you very much.=A0 Cam on.=A0 (Applause.)

=A0

So I'm just going to introduce very quickly these outstanding young busin=
esspeople who are leading the way here in Vietnam.=A0 We invited them her=
e to give us some of their thoughts about what would make it easier for t=
hem to start their businesses and to continue to nurture the startups tha=
t they=92re involved with.=A0=20

=A0

The first is Khoa Pham, who is the director of Legal and Corporate at Mic=
rosoft Vietnam.=A0 We have Le Hoang Uyen Vy, who is the founder of Adayro=
i, which is aiming to become the Amazon of Vietnam.=A0 And we have Do Thi=
 Thuy Hang, who=92s the vice president of Seedcom, which invests in Vietn=
amese companies.=A0 So please give them a big round of applause, and we'l=
l start our conversation.=A0 (Applause.)

=A0

So, Vy, let's start with you.=A0 And tell us -- it sounds like you starte=
d being interested in business at a very young age.

=A0

VY:=A0 Good evening, Mr. President.=A0 And good evening, everyone.=A0 Fir=
st of all, I'd like to say thank you to the Vietnamese and U.S. governmen=
ts for organizing such a wonderful event.=A0 My name is Vy, and I graduat=
ed from Georgetown University in 2009, majoring in finance.=A0 Actually, =
I have a passion for technology when I was in school.=A0 When I was 13, I=
 decided to start my own web design company.=A0 And I love the idea of co=
nnecting buyers and sellers to an online platform, just like eBay or Amaz=
on.

=A0

But at the moment, I was so young and I couldn't start a formal business.=
=A0 And therefore, after my college graduation, I decided to come back to=
 Vietnam and started -- an e-marketplace selling fashion items.=A0 And lu=
ckily, after five years, we became one of the top destination for fashion=
 lovers in Vietnam.=A0 And we got acquired by the biggest conglomerate in=
 Vietnam.=A0 And right now I'm running Adayroi.com.=A0 Basically, we're t=
he Amazon of Vietnam.=A0 We sell everything from electronics to even groc=
eries online.=A0 And our goal is to bring safe and high-quality products =
at affordable price to every family in Vietnam.

=A0

PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 That's great.=A0 Now, you look very good.=A0 Is this =
some of your fashion that you can sell online?=A0 (Laughter.)=A0 Is that =
like you can buy the necklace and the earrings?

=A0

VY:=A0 They are available on Adayroi.com.=A0 (Laughter.)=A0=20

=A0

PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 So if you're looking for a good deal -- (laughter.)=A0=
 Excellent.=A0=20

=A0

And, Hang, you started out as an entrepreneur.=A0 Now you're an investor =
as well.=A0 Tell us what have been the challenges that you=92ve met.=A0 A=
nd there have been some special challenges about being a woman entreprene=
ur and investor here in Vietnam.=A0=20

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 HANG:=A0 Mr. President, I am glad to be here as well.=A0 I g=
uess let=92s take it back a little bit.=A0 I came back to Vietnam five ye=
ars ago after nine years in the States.=A0 So America is truly my second =
home.=A0 And when I came back it was basically because of my very close t=
ies with Vietnam.=A0 My family has been here; my hometown is here; a lot =
of people here.=A0 Because the environment has been very supporting, I've=
 learned a lot from previous generations.=A0 And certainly because I have=
 seen successful role models here, that's why I came back.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 I never thought that being a female entrepreneur would be a =
disadvantage here in the local market because, from my experience and obs=
ervations about the area, I'm very proud to say that in Vietnam women are=
 treated equally and given a lot of opportunity. So whether we try or not=
 is all stuff within ourselves.=A0 And we see a lot of women entrepreneur=
s in the room as well.=A0 Le Hoang Uyen Vy, who you just mentioned, she=92=
s incredible.=A0 She=92s not an entrepreneur, per se, but she has done a =
terrific job here in Ho Chi Minh City.=A0 We all love her.=A0 (Laughter a=
nd applause.)=A0=20

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 So if the world was run by women -- and I'm thinking the Uni=
ted States election this year -- it would be a better place.=A0 Like you =
always say.=A0 You always say that.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 I do.=A0 (Laughter.)=A0 So what kind of =
businesses are you looking to invest in at this point?

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 HANG:=A0 Vietnam is among the top exporters of agricultural =
products in the world.=A0 Yet there are a lot of untapped opportunities i=
n agriculture.=A0 And it is a very low-tech, low-productivity sector.=A0 =
And at Seedcom, we've worked with a lot of companies across retail, techn=
ology and logistics.=A0 But the project that we're most excited about at =
the moment is in agriculture.=A0 We apply technology to traditional farmi=
ng -- stuff like tracking automation.=A0 Basically we bring the product a=
ll the way to end user at a higher value.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 So that is I guess the next wave in innovation in Vietnam, w=
here entrepreneurs and investors come together, using technology to tackl=
e very traditional industries.=A0=20

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 So, Pham, you were born here, moved to t=
he States when you were 11.=A0 Is that right?

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 PHAM:=A0 That's right.=A0=20

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 And got your education there, worked in =
Washington, ended up at a very impressive startup called Microsoft.=A0 (L=
aughter.)=A0 And so now you're here representing Microsoft in Ho Chi Minh=
 City.=A0 Tell us about, what are the opportunities that Microsoft is see=
ing?=A0 And how you think U.S. companies can most effectively interact wi=
th Vietnamese businesspeople and startups and entrepreneurs.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 PHAM:=A0 Well, welcome to Vietnam, Mr. President.=A0 I know =
it's early morning in Washington, D.C. --

=A0

PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 I'm getting over the jetlag.

=A0

PHAM:=A0 -- so I'm glad you're awake.=A0 (Laughter.)=A0 So I returned to =
Vietnam for the same reason that my parents had when they took me out of =
Vietnam as a young boy, and that is that they wanted me to have an opport=
unity for a better life.=A0 And we found that in the U.S.=A0 And after 35=
 years living in the U.S., I decided to return to Vietnam to give the sam=
e opportunities and to make a difference to the young people of Vietnam -=
- maybe some sitting here today.=A0=20

=A0

And so the way I look at my return is that Microsoft gives me the opportu=
nity to make a difference, to improve lives for people, to produce the te=
chnology, as well as to accelerate the development of the country through=
 technology by the improvement of our IT infrastructure.=A0 So I see a lo=
t of investors, young entrepreneurs, and the spirit of entrepreneurship h=
ere in Vietnam.=A0 And that is the reason I returned to Vietnam.

=A0

PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 So, Vy, you were mentioning how you want to be the Am=
azon of Vietnam.=A0 Tell me about the challenges you have in trying to bu=
ild a digital platform for commerce here in Vietnam, and what makes it di=
fferent trying to develop that here than it might be in the United States=
, where, obviously, there=92s more digital platforms and penetration.=A0 =
I'm assuming that, particularly if you want to reach rural areas, that so=
me of the logistical challenges are different.=A0 So tell us what has bee=
n some of the hardest aspects of building on your vision, and how do you =
think both the Vietnamese government, or the United States government, or=
 companies that are interested in working with you or other entrepreneurs=
 -- how they can be most helpful.=A0 Where do you see the biggest roadblo=
cks?

=A0

VY:=A0 -- about bringing convenience and more lifestyle to the Vietnamese=
 people.=A0 Imagine that working moms have a job from 9:00 to 6:00, and t=
hen after 6:00 p.m., she has to rush to the supermarket to shop for her d=
inner, it would probably take her an hour to get home, and then ready to =
cook for the family.

=A0

PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 Because the traffic is --

=A0

VY:=A0 Right, the traffic jam.=A0 (Laughter.)=A0 So imagine that one day =
she can sit in her office and order all the ingredients, and when she get=
s home the meal will be ready for her to cook dinner for her family.=A0 S=
o every day we can save her an hour to spend more time with her family.=A0=
 Imagine that we can save her 360 hours per year, which translates to 7,3=
00 hours over 20 years, which is equivalent to almost a year.=A0 So we ca=
n save a woman a year over 20 years.=A0 So that's now our dream.=A0=20

=A0

But basically, it's very challenging because even online grocery is diffi=
cult because of the infrastructure.=A0 It's very difficult for us to get =
the items to the customer on time, and especially when you have a commitm=
ent to deliver it within two hours, which is quite impossible when we fir=
st started.=A0 But then we are very committed.=A0 So we do our own delive=
ry structure, we do our own delivery.=A0 And up to now I think we have a =
feeling of it so we are able to deliver our product as fast as we can to =
satisfy the customers.

=A0

So a couple challenges that I think either the government in Vietnam or t=
he U.S. government can help us is, first, to help us to develop our infra=
structure -- the logistics, the payment structure, and bring technology t=
o Vietnam.=A0 So that's always been my dream.

=A0

PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 So one of the challenges is just making sure that you=
 have the physical infrastructure so that you can deliver fast enough.=A0=
 But in terms of the digital infrastructure, is that well developed, beca=
use everybody has a smartphone now?

=A0

VY:=A0 It's much, much better now because people are getting used to usin=
g their smartphone to order things online.=A0 Three years ago, when I fir=
st started, it was so difficult to get people online.=A0 But now it's ver=
y easy.=A0 But still -- so the operational infrastructure is not there ye=
t, so we need to learn it from successful companies like Amazon, or we ne=
ed to come up with our own solution in Vietnam.=A0 Because the industry i=
n Vietnam is not the same as the U.S.=A0 You understand, right?=A0 So we =
have all the deliverymen on motorbike.=A0 And they have to know their way=
 around.=A0 It's very difficult to install GPS.

=A0

PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 And just one last question.=A0 In terms of access to =
capital, typically, are startups here self-financed, or are they financed=
 through the banks?=A0 Is there enough of sort of a bank infrastructure f=
or small businesses and medium-sized businesses?=A0 Or are you using -- a=
re most entrepreneurs using family savings?=A0 Is there venture capital?=A0=
 How are people getting started?

=A0

VY:=A0 That's a very good question.=A0 To be honest, I think in Vietnam, =
it's very difficult to get early funding.=A0 Especially there=92s not tha=
t many venture capital funding here in Vietnam.=A0 For seed funding and i=
nvestors, very limited.=A0 I think most of the investors in Vietnam, they=
 want to invest in companies that have track records, which is quite a ch=
allenge for a startup in Vietnam.=A0 So we have family startup here.=A0 I=
t's good news for us. And we hope that in the near future, more venture f=
unds can come to Vietnam, especially from America, to help us grow all of=
 the new businesses.

=A0

PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 Well, I'm trying to do some advertising for you here.=
=A0 (Laughter.)=A0 Hopefully somebody is paying attention back in the Uni=
ted States.=A0=20

=A0

So, Hang, you were talking about agriculture.=A0 Obviously a large portio=
n of Vietnam is still dependent on basic agricultural and small farmers.=A0=
 Is the goal here for them to be able to move their products to market at=
 a better price and more quickly?=A0 Or is it that you want to move up th=
e value chain so that there=92s more processing that's taking place, so i=
t's not just rice or other crops, but it's also the products that are der=
ived from the foodstuffs that are being grown?=A0 Or is it all of the abo=
ve?=A0 Tell me a little bit more about how you see the opportunity for ag=
riculture to accelerate here in Vietnam.

=A0

HANG:=A0 I guess all of the above.=A0 Of course, myself, we cannot change=
 the (inaudible), but many investors and entrepreneurs working together, =
we can make an impact.=A0 So as I mentioned, there are two partners in ou=
r business.=A0 One is to apply more technology.=A0 Some technology is jus=
t very, very simple.=A0 You can text message.=A0 You can (inaudible) on t=
he farm, et cetera.=A0 That improves the productivity massively, and that=
 helps the farmers to increase their output and, as a result, their incom=
e.=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=20

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 And secondly, basically, have a trust and more value and bri=
ng the products to the end users at a higher price.=A0 And obviously the =
result of that is also higher income.=A0 And we understand that there are=
 a lot of challenges like you mentioned. Logistically, it's not there yet=
.=A0 The infrastructure, there is a lot to do.=A0 But we are a very young=
 team and they are farmers and they have a lot of -- I know personally a =
lot of people, young people who work in agriculture.=A0 And we have so mu=
ch passion and energy and drive, and beyond that, we even have a strategy=
 and action plan to make this happen.=A0 So hopefully, in the next few ye=
ars you see some very positive change in agriculture in Vietnam.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 So, Pham, when you think about business =
here versus business as you're accustomed to seeing in the United States,=
 what are some of the big differences?=A0 And are there particular areas =
where you think a strategic investment would make a big difference in hel=
ping all these startups take off?=A0 And in terms of Microsoft=92s strate=
gy, are your main clients large businesses, and just helping them with re=
spect to IT, or are you also working with some of these smaller startups =
to see how you can grow their businesses and hopefully help them really t=
ake off?

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 PHAM:=A0 I'm sure you have heard from -- our CO.=A0 Our comp=
any mission is to empower every person, every organization on the planet =
to achieve more.=A0 And I think there is no better market to do that than=
 in Vietnam, because of the young entrepreneurs that we have here and the=
 penetration, the mobile base that we have here with young people.=A0 And=
 I think that in terms of capturing the opportunity, I think that's impor=
tant for us to look at -- for our government -- and businesses and entrep=
reneurs to really balance the opportunity and the responsibility in this =
new world that we live in, which is a mobile world.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 And so if we look at the challenges in that respect, I think=
 public policy, regulatory environment -- it needs to be more conducive, =
it needs to be modernized to address the digital economy.=A0 And I think =
that Vietnam is not unique in that space of the developing market.=A0 I t=
hink in the U.S. that the same things have been faced with how do we deal=
 with e-commerce across borders, taxation issues and things of that natur=
e.=A0 But I think that Vietnam can (inaudible) other markets, and seeing =
and capturing that opportunity.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 For Microsoft Vietnam, in particular, we have a national emp=
owerment plan that basically mirrors the government ICT master plan by 20=
20 to really develop Vietnam in ICT advanced nation.=A0 And so, in that r=
egard, we look at the three key pillars, which is the ICT infrastructure =
of a country, helping really secure the cybersecurity apparatus of the co=
untry, really looking at the issue of privacy with the protection of the =
ICT infrastructure for a national cloud -- to really take advantage of th=
at.=A0=20

=A0

And also our investment, in the second pillar, which is about small and m=
edium-sized enterprises -- I think that is going to be the driving factor=
 for the economic growth in this country. We have about 500,000 businesse=
s here of that size, and so I would say that the startup community is als=
o the micro businesses that are starting out.=A0 And we have programs tha=
t provide free software, free cloud services to these startups.=A0 So thi=
s way, they can really focus on developing the best products.=A0=20

=A0

And then, honestly, the education side, we really have to look at capacit=
y building, and that is to really help the Vietnamese move from a labor-i=
ntensive economy into more of a knowledge economy, knowledge-based econom=
y.=A0 And that is really getting them the right skill set for ICT skill s=
et and also we need to really invest a bit more on STEM education.=A0 And=
 we're doing that -- and teaching the technology in the classrooms, and r=
eally doing a lot of these startup community, coworking space, community =
events to really promote coding, because I think that's very important.=A0=
 And I think (inaudible) -- I think that's something we do here annually =
as well.

=A0

PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 I think that's a great point, and, Vy and Hang, maybe=
 you want to talk about this a little bit.=A0 Ultimately, what makes star=
tups and entrepreneurs successful is good ideas and the human capital.=A0=
 Obviously investors are important and infrastructure is important, but t=
he most important thing is people.=A0 And when you look at Vietnam right =
now, it seems as if a culture of entrepreneurship is really beginning to =
grow.=A0 But one of the questions that I always have to ask myself in the=
 United States is whether our education system is equipping our children =
effectively enough to be able to move forward on their ideas.

=A0

So you're both very young, so you can still remember what it's like to go=
 to school.=A0 (Laughter.)=A0 For me, I've forgotten. But I will say that=
 when I was going to school we didn=92t have computers.=A0 Well, you had =
these big mainframe computers, but you didn=92t have personal computers.=A0=
 (Laughter.)=A0=20

=A0

How do you see the education system here adapting to the needs of this ne=
w 21st century economy?

=A0

VY:=A0 I still remember taking entrepreneurship classes in the U.S. and I=
 found it so helpful for me to learn about how to write a business plan, =
how to pitch to an investor -- and I think when I got back here, I don't =
find many entrepreneurship classes in Vietnam.=A0 So I think that's an em=
pty area that we can tap on.=A0=20

=A0

And secondly, I think after the startup gets funding, I think they also n=
eed mentorship program.=A0 Those are the things that really helps the sta=
rtup community in Vietnam.=A0 And I also think that -- I used to be an ex=
change student.=A0 I came to U.S. when I was 17.=A0 I'm very thankful for=
 that because I learned so much about innovation and I learned how to dre=
am big and always hope for a brighter future.=A0 So I think there=92s a c=
hance for us to also create exchange programs, not just for students but =
for working adults.=A0 Especially we can send young startups to do on-the=
-job training or internship program at some U.S. company.=A0 So those are=
 the things that I really want to get to the audience.

=A0

PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 Good.

=A0

Hang?

=A0

HANG:=A0 I'd like to add to what Vy just said -- the power of technology.=
=A0 Again, I go back to this.=A0 Students now, they have access to a lot =
more information, and education opens new sector for startups to come and=
 basically (inaudible.)=A0 So a friend, he has a education startup.=A0 An=
other friend who I know very well, she launched a startup that helps stud=
ents learn English through an app.=A0 So all of those examples you can se=
e that technology basically opens the door and opens opportunities for Vi=
etnamese students to access global knowledge.

=A0

And the evidence of that is most of the teams that I work with in Vietnam=
 for my previous startup -- they all are educated in Vietnam.=A0 I'm one =
of the very lucky few that got years of education in the States.=A0 But I=
 respect my colleagues a lot every day -- they=92re so smart.=A0 They lea=
rn in Vietnam.=A0 They learn not only by going to school, but also by doi=
ng, by talking to older people, and obviously learning from the Internet.=
=A0 So I do think technology is changing education.

=A0

PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 Well, Pham was talking about leapfrogging. One of the=
 things that you're seeing in countries all around the world is if they h=
aven't already developed a telephone infrastructure with landlines and te=
lephone poles and underground tunnels, now, suddenly, they just go straig=
ht to cellular towers and smartphones.=A0 And banking is done there, and =
commerce is done through phones.=A0 And so they=92ve leapfrogged over the=
 infrastructure requirements of both systems.=A0=20

=A0

And the same is true with education.=A0 If done properly, the opportunity=
 for online education that is much cheaper but is still of high quality t=
hat can accelerate the ability of a child here in Vietnam to learn coding=
, learn business practices and so forth, without an expensive education o=
r having to study overseas is hugely important.=A0 And with our contribut=
ion through the Peace Corps, through entrepreneurship summits, through th=
e sponsorships that we're getting various companies to engage in, our hop=
e is, is that we'll be able to provide the kind of training to young peop=
le that will be incredibly powerful for them in the future.=A0=20

=A0

And we want to thank the Vietnamese government for their cooperation, bec=
ause a lot of these systems that we're trying to build we could not do if=
 it were not for the strong support that we're receiving from them.=A0=20=


=A0

But any other closing thoughts that you think either the President of the=
 United States or the President of Vietnam or any of these business leade=
rs here should hear about?

=A0

Q=A0=A0=A0 Mr. President, let me ask you a question.=A0 (Laughter.)=A0=20=


=A0=A0=A0=A0 PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 Oh, sure.=A0 The tide is turned.=A0 (Lau=
ghter.)=A0=20

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 Q=A0=A0=A0 So when you were a kid, did you dream of becoming=
 President one day?

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 No.=A0 (Laughter.)=A0 I think there are =
some people who they had a very clear vision for themselves.=A0 I really =
didn=92t -- I was not as well organized as all of you when I was young.=A0=
 I think it wasn=92t until I was in college that I began to develop a sen=
se of wanting to make a difference.=A0 And even then I did not know exact=
ly how I might do it.=A0=20

=A0

I was actually very skeptical of politics because I thought politicians w=
eren=92t always looking out for the people; that too often, I thought, th=
ey were looking out for themselves.=A0 So I actually worked in communitie=
s to try to hold politicians accountable.=A0 That was the first job that =
I did in the nonprofit sector.

=A0

So it wasn=92t really until I think I finished law school that I thought =
that I might be interested in public service.=A0 In fact, I went to law s=
chool with my now who is my Trade Representative, our Ambassador Michael =
Froman.=A0 And he was much smarter than me. (Laughter.)=A0 But it wasn=92=
t until I came out of law school that I thought that maybe I might run fo=
r office at some point.=20

=A0

But the important point I think I want to make is that so many of the you=
ng people here today -- certainly all of you -- well, you sort of qualify=
 as young.=A0 (Laughter.)=A0 Young at heart. (Laughter.)=A0 These two are=
 young.=A0 You're younger than me.=A0 (Laughter.)=A0 But so many of the y=
oung people I meet today I think have a different idea of their careers a=
nd their lives.=A0 I think they=92re much more sophisticated.=A0 I think =
the Internet has exposed them to a lot more ideas of what they can do.=A0=
 I believe that many young people recognize that the old system where you=
 find yourself a job and then you work in that same job for 30 or 40 year=
s is less likely to be the path for them because the economy is just chan=
ging so quickly.

=A0

And so I think there=92s much more interest on the part of all the young =
people I meet -- certainly here in Southeast Asia, in the States, Africa,=
 Europe, wherever I go -- to try to make it on their own, and to try to f=
ind collaborations with groups of people who are interested in the same t=
hings they are, and to see if they can make it happen.=A0 And I think tha=
t's a wonderful thing.=A0 It's challenging.=A0 I think one of the well-kn=
own rules in Silicon Valley is, is that if you haven't failed quite a bit=
 then you're probably not a very good entrepreneur because the first idea=
 you have is not always going to work.=A0 And you have to be resilient an=
d be able to learn from your failures as much as your successes.=A0=20

=A0

But I truly believe that this generation is not only being entrepreneuria=
l when it thinks about business, but also entrepreneurial when it thinks =
about trying to solve social problems; entrepreneurial when it thinks abo=
ut government and making government more responsive and accountable to or=
dinary people.=A0 And it makes me very hopeful for the future.=A0=20

=A0

Q=A0=A0=A0 I guess the entrepreneurial spirit is very much engrained in V=
ietnamese people, just like for Americans.=A0 And you have seen, and just=
 now have seen here the very vibrant startup business community here in H=
o Chi Minh City.=A0 Just imagine how much more it can be if there is more=
 exchange, of knowledge, of capital, technical know-how between the two c=
ountries, the U.S. and Vietnam.=A0=20

=A0

And on that note, my question for you would be, if your daughter took a g=
ap year from Harvard College, so tells you next week that she wants to li=
ve in Vietnam for a year, what would you tell her?

=A0

PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 Oh, I would encourage it.=A0 But what I've learned is=
, is that -- my daughter Malia will be 18 next month, and she already doe=
sn=92t listen to me, whatever I say.=A0 (Laughter.)=A0 So if you want her=
 to come to Vietnam, I shouldn=92t be the one to tell her.=A0 (Laughter.)=
=A0 Maybe you should tell her. Yes, absolutely.=A0 But certainly I would =
recommend students from the States to come and study here as much as I'm =
encouraging Vietnamese students to come and study in the United States.

=A0

Young people are going to be living in an interconnected world, in a glob=
al marketplace.=A0 And every business has to think globally.=A0 Even smal=
l businesses.=A0 If you have a good product today, you can reach billions=
 of people if you have a good strategy, you have good marketing, you can =
handle the logistics. And so the barriers to entry that used to exist whe=
re only a Boeing or a GE or a very large company could operate in Vietnam=
 is no longer true.=A0 And the same is true for small businesses here in =
Vietnam.=A0 If you have an interesting product that is unique and perhaps=
 is very common in Vietnam, but nobody knows about in the United States, =
oftentimes some of the best ways to start a business is to take something=
 that is very popular in one place but is unknown someplace else and be t=
he first person to sell that product in another country.

=A0

So I think part of the education that young people have to have is to und=
erstand other cultures and understand other markets.=A0 If you're lucky e=
nough to be able to travel, then that's one way to do it.=A0 But one of t=
he wonderful things about the Internet is it gives you an opportunity to =
learn about another place, even if you can't set foot there.=A0 So that's=
 something that I continually emphasize.=20

=A0

Last question or comment.

=A0

PHAM:=A0 I have a question.=A0 In your opening remarks, you mentioned abo=
ut TPP, and we didn=92t have a chance to talk about that.=A0 And so TPP i=
s considered a 21st century trade agreement, dealing directly with the di=
gital economy, talking about the rules of law extending to security and p=
rivacy and also cost more (inaudible.)=A0 TPP is very important to Vietna=
m, and I know that the Vietnamese business community supports it.=A0 And =
as an employee of Microsoft, I can reaffirm that our company supports TPP=
.=A0=20

=A0

As we look at the latest report published by the U.S. International Trade=
 Commission, that indicates that, fully implemented, TPP will bring about=
 $57 billion into the U.S. economy.=A0 But apparently, the U.S. -- Americ=
an politics is sort of turning against TPP.=A0 So I'd like to hear from y=
ou, what do you think is going to be -- what it takes to pass TPP in Wash=
ington, D.C.=A0 And what will you do in your power to make that happen?

=A0

PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 Well, it's a great question.=A0 And first of all, jus=
t to describe why TPP is so important.=A0 What TPP does is it takes 12 co=
untries along the Asia Pacific region that represent a huge portion of th=
e entire world=92s marketplace, and it says we're going to create standar=
ds for trade and commerce that are fair; that create a level playing fiel=
d; that have high standards; that encourage rule of law; that encourage p=
rotection of intellectual property -- so if Vy or Hang come up with a gre=
at idea, somebody is not just going to steal it off the Internet but the =
work that they=92ve put in is protected; that has strong environmental pr=
ovisions so that countries can't just take advantage of no environmental =
protection to undercut competitors who are following more responsible env=
ironmental practices.

=A0

And not only do all the countries who are participating stand to gain fro=
m increased trade, but Vietnam, in particular, I think economists who hav=
e studied it believe would be one of the biggest beneficiaries.=A0=20

=A0

From the United States=92 perspective, it's a common-sense thing to do be=
cause, frankly, our markets are already more open than many of the market=
s of the countries that are signing up.=A0 So Japan, for example, is able=
 to sell a lot of cars in the United States but has a lot of problems imp=
orting beef from the United States.=A0 And what we've done is to make sur=
e that a lot of the tariffs that are currently being placed on U.S. expor=
ts and U.S. goods are reduced.=A0=20

=A0

And so it will create a better environment for U.S. businesses -- particu=
larly because of some of the intellectual property protections, a lot of =
what we sell today are products of our knowledge-based economy.=A0 And so=
 it's a smart thing to do across the board.

=A0

Now, the problem in the United States around trade -- and this is not new=
.=A0 This has been true for the last 30 years -- is that some of the prev=
ious trade agreements did not have enforceable labor protections or envir=
onmental protections.=A0 I think when China came in to the WTO, it was ab=
le to take advantage of the growing global supply chain, and a lot of man=
ufacturing shifted to China in a very visible way.=A0 So a lot of America=
ns saw companies close and saw what they viewed as their jobs being expor=
ted to China.=A0 And some of that happened in Mexico, with NAFTA as well.=


=A0

And so the perception was that this is bad for U.S. workers and U.S. jobs=
.=A0 If you look at the data, then what is true is that some manufacturin=
g jobs were lost as a consequence of trade. On the other hand, other sect=
ors of the economy improved significantly.=A0 And overall, it was good fo=
r the U.S. economy.=A0 But I think that in the design of some of the oil =
trade deals and some of the mistakes that may have been made in the past,=
 people became suspicious of trade and worried that if we do TPP, then th=
e same pattern will repeat itself, and the U.S. will lose more jobs.=A0=20=


=A0

My argument is that if you're dissatisfied with the current trading arran=
gements where tariffs are placed on U.S. goods but other goods are alread=
y coming into the U.S., why would you want to just maintain the status qu=
o?=A0 Why not change it so that everybody is operating in a fair and tran=
sparent way?

=A0

And the good news is, is that the majority of Americans still believe in =
trade and still believe that it's good for our economy.=A0 The bad news i=
s politics in the United States is not always -- how would I put it -- re=
asonable.=A0 That's the word I'm looking for.=A0 (Laughter.)=A0 But I'm c=
onfident that we're going to be able to get it done because, in the past =
when we negotiated trade deals, even though there=92s a lot of opposition=
, at the end of the day we end up getting it done.=A0 Keep in mind that w=
e negotiated a very big free trade agreement with Korea, and even though =
the Bush administration negotiated it, he didn=92t get it passed, when I =
came into office, one of the first things we did was we worked with Korea=
, we made some small modifications to some of the terms and we got it don=
e, and it's in force today.

=A0

So the argument that I've made and I will continue to make in the United =
States is that we're not going to be able to end globalization.=A0 We hav=
e to make globalization work for us.=A0 And that means that we don't try =
to put barriers and walls between us and the rest of the world; but inste=
ad, we try to make sure that the world has high standards, treats our com=
panies fairly.=A0 And if we do that, I'm confident we can compete with an=
ybody.

=A0

So nothing is easy in Washington these days.=A0 But despite sometimes the=
 lack of cooperation with Congress, I seem to be able to get a lot of thi=
ngs done anyway.=A0 (Laughter.)=A0 It could have been easier.=A0 I would =
have less gray hair -- (laughter) -- if Congress was working more effecti=
vely, but we do have some members of Congress who are here.=A0 That's Con=
gressman Castro and Congressman O=92Rourke who are two outstanding young =
congressmen from Texas.=A0 They=92re strong TPP supporters and we're very=
 proud of the work that they=92ve done.=A0 So we're just going to have to=
 work hard to convince some of their colleagues.=A0 But ultimately I thin=
k we can get it passed.=20

=A0

Well, everybody, I think that if you have any doubt about the outstanding=
 future of Vietnamese entrepreneurs, then all those doubts have been push=
ed away because of the outstanding presentations by these three individua=
ls.=A0 Give them a big round of applause.=A0 (Applause.)=A0=20

=A0

Thank you so much.=A0 (Applause.)=A0=20

k you.&nbsp; Zin ch=E0o.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp;=
 Thank you.&nbsp; Well, it=92s wonderful to be here in Ho Chi Minh City.&nb=
sp; Please have a seat.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><p></p></span=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I just had the opportunit=
y to visit the Jade Emperor Pagoda. And I think going from a 100-year-old s=
acred temple to this 21st century Dreamplex is I think a wonderful expressi=
on of the evolution that's taken place
 here in Vietnam -- a country that honors its history, but is also boldly r=
acing towards the future.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And that=92s also the sto=
ry of this city.&nbsp; This is a city on the move.&nbsp; And we could see a=
s we were traveling in from the airport all the activity that's currently t=
aking place.&nbsp; And I=92m not just talking about the
 traffic -- (laughter) -- although I do think it might be easier to be on a=
 motorbike than a motorcade.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But this city, like this =
country, is full of energy.&nbsp; You can see it in the skyscrapers shootin=
g above the horizon and the shops that are springing up at every corner.&nb=
sp; You can spot it online, where tens of millions
 of Vietnamese are connecting with each other and with the world.&nbsp; And=
 you can feel it here at DreamPlex, where ideas are becoming a reality.&nbs=
p; I just had the chance to see some of those ideas in action -- young peop=
le who are making things happen.&nbsp; I saw a
 virtual game that can help people recover from nerve injuries, to a machin=
e that lets your smartphone control a laser-cutter -- although you have to =
be careful with the laser-cutter where you point it.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp=
;&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But some of this energy m=
ay be due to your famous c=E0 ph=EA tr=FAng.&nbsp; That stuff is strong, I =
understand.&nbsp; But the real driver of Vietnam=92s growth, and the engine=
 of Ho Chi Minh City, is the spirit of entrepreneurship
 -- the spirit that brings us here today.&nbsp; <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I see it everywhere I=
 travel all around the world.&nbsp; I meet people -- and especially young p=
eople, like the three that we're about to meet -- who are eager to strike o=
ut on their own, start something new, and
 shape their own destinies.&nbsp; Many want to do more than just create a g=
reat new appropriate for a phone.&nbsp; They want to contribute to their co=
mmunities and help people live better lives.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And that=92s what entrepr=
eneurship is all about.&nbsp; It's building businesses -- making a profit, =
hopefully.&nbsp; But it's also about creating good jobs, and developing new=
 products, and devising ways to serve others.&nbsp; Entrepreneurship
 is also the fuel for prosperity that puts rising economies on the path to =
success. It=92s what gives young people like so many of you the chance to c=
hannel your energy and your passion into something that is bigger than your=
selves.&nbsp; And it allows us to come
 together across countries and cultures to solve some of the world=92s grea=
test challenges.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Of course, being an entre=
preneur is not easy.&nbsp; It=92s not easy in the United States; it's not e=
asy here in Vietnam; it's not easy anyplace in the world.&nbsp; It can be t=
ough to get started.&nbsp; It=92s hard to access capital.&nbsp;
 It's hard to get the skills that you need to run a business.&nbsp; You mig=
ht not always have the mentors and the networks that can help guide you alo=
ng the way.&nbsp; And it can be especially difficult for women, for others =
who traditionally are not viewed as being
 at the center of business life in a country, haven't had all the access to=
 the same opportunities.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we=92ve got to tap all=
 the talent that's out there.&nbsp; Just because you are born poor does not=
 mean you should not be able to start a business.&nbsp; Just because you do=
n't look like the traditional businessman doesn=92t
 mean you can't make a great product or deliver a great service.&nbsp; <p><=
/p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And that=92s why DreamPle=
x is so important.&nbsp; It=92s not only a home for digital entrepreneurs l=
ike you.&nbsp; It=92s also a place where you can share ideas and work toget=
her and build a community that supports each other.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And incubators like this =
allow Vietnam, alongside its emphasis on entrepreneurship, to see more star=
tups happening in this country than ever before.&nbsp; Recently, in one yea=
r alone, the funding for startups doubled
 in this country.&nbsp; And we=92re seeing major acquisitions, like Fossil =
Group=92s takeover Misfit Wearables, a Vietnamese company that makes device=
s like fitness trackers.&nbsp; We=92re seeing Vietnamese-Americans who are =
coming here to start new ventures -- and that shows
 a strong bond between the United States and Vietnam.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the world is taking n=
otice.&nbsp; A leading global venture capital firm called 500 Startups just=
 launched a $10 million fund here in Ho Chi Minh City.&nbsp; Next month at =
our Global Entrepreneurship Summit -- something
 that I've been hosting now for several years -- I=92ll welcome eight Vietn=
amese entrepreneurs to Silicon Valley, so that they can learn from some of =
the best entrepreneurs and startups and venture capitalists in the world. A=
nd your success sends a message to
 global investors about this country=92s incredible potential for innovatio=
n.&nbsp; Hopefully it also encourages other Vietnamese entrepreneurs to cha=
se that new great idea and start that new company, which will continue to f=
uel an ever-expanding Vietnam economy.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I=92m here today because =
the United States is committed to being a partner as you grow.&nbsp; With t=
he Peace Corps coming to Vietnam for the first time, our volunteers are goi=
ng to help more Vietnamese learn English --
 the language that so often is used in the global economy.&nbsp; With progr=
ams like our Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative, we=92re helping give=
 thousands of young people across Vietnam the skills and networks they need=
 to turn their ideas into action.&nbsp; With
 our U.S.-ASEAN Connect Initiative, we=92re matching American investors wit=
h Vietnamese entrepreneurs in areas like clean energy.&nbsp; With the women=
=92s entrepreneurship center we=92re going to open here in Vietnam -- WECRE=
ATE is what we're going to call it -- we=92ll
 help empower the next generation of women business owners.&nbsp; <p></p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And if we really want to =
encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, I should mention that we need to=
 move ahead with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, because TPP will not only l=
et us sell more of our goods to each
 other and bring our economies closer together, it will accelerate economic=
 reforms here in Vietnam, boost your economic competitiveness, open up new =
markets not only for large companies but also for small and medium-sized bu=
sinesses.&nbsp; It will raise labor and
 environmental standards, and it will improve business conditions so that e=
ntrepreneurs like you can thrive.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So my message to all the =
entrepreneurs here today is that I believe in you, America believes in you,=
 and we=92re going to keep investing in your success.&nbsp; Ultimately, it=
=92s the inventors and dreamers, people like those
 that I just met, those that we'll hear from soon, and all of you in the au=
dience who are going to shape Vietnam=92s future for decades to come.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I'm looking forward to=
 hearing from these outstanding young leaders.&nbsp; Thank you very much.&n=
bsp; Cam on.&nbsp; (Applause.)<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I'm just going to intr=
oduce very quickly these outstanding young businesspeople who are leading t=
he way here in Vietnam.&nbsp; We invited them here to give us some of their=
 thoughts about what would make it easier
 for them to start their businesses and to continue to nurture the startups=
 that they=92re involved with.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The first is Khoa Pham, w=
ho is the director of Legal and Corporate at Microsoft Vietnam.&nbsp; We ha=
ve Le Hoang Uyen Vy, who is the founder of Adayroi, which is aiming to beco=
me the Amazon of Vietnam.&nbsp; And we have Do
 Thi Thuy Hang, who=92s the vice president of Seedcom, which invests in Vie=
tnamese companies.&nbsp; So please give them a big round of applause, and w=
e'll start our conversation.&nbsp; (Applause.)<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, Vy, let's start with =
you.&nbsp; And tell us -- it sounds like you started being interested in bu=
siness at a very young age.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">VY:&nbsp; Good evening, M=
r. President.&nbsp; And good evening, everyone.&nbsp; First of all, I'd lik=
e to say thank you to the Vietnamese and U.S. governments for organizing su=
ch a wonderful event.&nbsp; My name is Vy, and I graduated
 from Georgetown University in 2009, majoring in finance.&nbsp; Actually, I=
 have a passion for technology when I was in school.&nbsp; When I was 13, I=
 decided to start my own web design company.&nbsp; And I love the idea of c=
onnecting buyers and sellers to an online platform,
 just like eBay or Amazon.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But at the moment, I was =
so young and I couldn't start a formal business.&nbsp; And therefore, after=
 my college graduation, I decided to come back to Vietnam and started -- an=
 e-marketplace selling fashion items.&nbsp; And
 luckily, after five years, we became one of the top destination for fashio=
n lovers in Vietnam.&nbsp; And we got acquired by the biggest conglomerate =
in Vietnam.&nbsp; And right now I'm running Adayroi.com.&nbsp; Basically, w=
e're the Amazon of Vietnam.&nbsp; We sell everything
 from electronics to even groceries online.&nbsp; And our goal is to bring =
safe and high-quality products at affordable price to every family in Vietn=
am.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Th=
at's great.&nbsp; Now, you look very good.&nbsp; Is this some of your fashi=
on that you can sell online?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Is that like you can b=
uy the necklace and the earrings?<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">VY:&nbsp; They are availa=
ble on Adayroi.com.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; So=
 if you're looking for a good deal -- (laughter.)&nbsp; Excellent.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And, Hang, you started ou=
t as an entrepreneur.&nbsp; Now you're an investor as well.&nbsp; Tell us w=
hat have been the challenges that you=92ve met.&nbsp; And there have been s=
ome special challenges about being a woman entrepreneur
 and investor here in Vietnam.&nbsp; <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HANG:&nbsp; Mr. President, =
I am glad to be here as well.&nbsp; I guess let=92s take it back a little b=
it.&nbsp; I came back to Vietnam five years ago after nine years in the Sta=
tes.&nbsp; So America is truly my second home.&nbsp; And when I came back i=
t was
 basically because of my very close ties with Vietnam.&nbsp; My family has =
been here; my hometown is here; a lot of people here.&nbsp; Because the env=
ironment has been very supporting, I've learned a lot from previous generat=
ions.&nbsp; And certainly because I have seen successful
 role models here, that's why I came back.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never thought that being =
a female entrepreneur would be a disadvantage here in the local market beca=
use, from my experience and observations about the area, I'm very proud to =
say that in Vietnam women are treated equally and given
 a lot of opportunity. So whether we try or not is all stuff within ourselv=
es.&nbsp; And we see a lot of women entrepreneurs in the room as well.&nbsp=
; Le Hoang Uyen Vy, who you just mentioned, she=92s incredible.&nbsp; She=
=92s not an entrepreneur, per se, but she has done a
 terrific job here in Ho Chi Minh City.&nbsp; We all love her.&nbsp; (Laugh=
ter and applause.)&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if the world was run by =
women -- and I'm thinking the United States election this year -- it would =
be a better place.&nbsp; Like you always say.&nbsp; You always say that.<p>=
</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; I do=
.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; So what kind of businesses are you looking to inv=
est in at this point?<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HANG:&nbsp; Vietnam is amon=
g the top exporters of agricultural products in the world.&nbsp; Yet there =
are a lot of untapped opportunities in agriculture.&nbsp; And it is a very =
low-tech, low-productivity sector.&nbsp; And at Seedcom, we've worked with
 a lot of companies across retail, technology and logistics.&nbsp; But the =
project that we're most excited about at the moment is in agriculture.&nbsp=
; We apply technology to traditional farming -- stuff like tracking automat=
ion.&nbsp; Basically we bring the product all the
 way to end user at a higher value.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that is I guess the next=
 wave in innovation in Vietnam, where entrepreneurs and investors come toge=
ther, using technology to tackle very traditional industries.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; So, =
Pham, you were born here, moved to the States when you were 11.&nbsp; Is th=
at right?<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PHAM:&nbsp; That's right.&n=
bsp; <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; And =
got your education there, worked in Washington, ended up at a very impressi=
ve startup called Microsoft.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And so now you're here=
 representing Microsoft in Ho Chi Minh City.&nbsp; Tell us about, what are
 the opportunities that Microsoft is seeing?&nbsp; And how you think U.S. c=
ompanies can most effectively interact with Vietnamese businesspeople and s=
tartups and entrepreneurs.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PHAM:&nbsp; Well, welcome t=
o Vietnam, Mr. President.&nbsp; I know it's early morning in Washington, D.=
C. --<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; I'=
m getting over the jetlag.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PHAM:&nbsp; -- so I'm gla=
d you're awake.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; So I returned to Vietnam for the sa=
me reason that my parents had when they took me out of Vietnam as a young b=
oy, and that is that they wanted me to have an opportunity
 for a better life.&nbsp; And we found that in the U.S.&nbsp; And after 35 =
years living in the U.S., I decided to return to Vietnam to give the same o=
pportunities and to make a difference to the young people of Vietnam -- may=
be some sitting here today.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And so the way I look at =
my return is that Microsoft gives me the opportunity to make a difference, =
to improve lives for people, to produce the technology, as well as to accel=
erate the development of the country
 through technology by the improvement of our IT infrastructure.&nbsp; So I=
 see a lot of investors, young entrepreneurs, and the spirit of entrepreneu=
rship here in Vietnam.&nbsp; And that is the reason I returned to Vietnam.<=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; So=
, Vy, you were mentioning how you want to be the Amazon of Vietnam.&nbsp; T=
ell me about the challenges you have in trying to build a digital platform =
for commerce here in Vietnam, and what makes it
 different trying to develop that here than it might be in the United State=
s, where, obviously, there=92s more digital platforms and penetration.&nbsp=
; I'm assuming that, particularly if you want to reach rural areas, that so=
me of the logistical challenges are different.&nbsp;
 So tell us what has been some of the hardest aspects of building on your v=
ision, and how do you think both the Vietnamese government, or the United S=
tates government, or companies that are interested in working with you or o=
ther entrepreneurs -- how they can
 be most helpful.&nbsp; Where do you see the biggest roadblocks?<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">VY:&nbsp; -- about bringi=
ng convenience and more lifestyle to the Vietnamese people.&nbsp; Imagine t=
hat working moms have a job from 9:00 to 6:00, and then after 6:00 p.m., sh=
e has to rush to the supermarket to shop for her
 dinner, it would probably take her an hour to get home, and then ready to =
cook for the family.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Be=
cause the traffic is --<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">VY:&nbsp; Right, the traf=
fic jam.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; So imagine that one day she can sit in her=
 office and order all the ingredients, and when she gets home the meal will=
 be ready for her to cook dinner for her family.&nbsp; So
 every day we can save her an hour to spend more time with her family.&nbsp=
; Imagine that we can save her 360 hours per year, which translates to 7,30=
0 hours over 20 years, which is equivalent to almost a year.&nbsp; So we ca=
n save a woman a year over 20 years.&nbsp; So that's
 now our dream.&nbsp; <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But basically, it's very =
challenging because even online grocery is difficult because of the infrast=
ructure.&nbsp; It's very difficult for us to get the items to the customer =
on time, and especially when you have a commitment
 to deliver it within two hours, which is quite impossible when we first st=
arted.&nbsp; But then we are very committed.&nbsp; So we do our own deliver=
y structure, we do our own delivery.&nbsp; And up to now I think we have a =
feeling of it so we are able to deliver our product
 as fast as we can to satisfy the customers.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So a couple challenges th=
at I think either the government in Vietnam or the U.S. government can help=
 us is, first, to help us to develop our infrastructure -- the logistics, t=
he payment structure, and bring technology
 to Vietnam.&nbsp; So that's always been my dream.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; So=
 one of the challenges is just making sure that you have the physical infra=
structure so that you can deliver fast enough.&nbsp; But in terms of the di=
gital infrastructure, is that well developed,
 because everybody has a smartphone now?<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">VY:&nbsp; It's much, much=
 better now because people are getting used to using their smartphone to or=
der things online.&nbsp; Three years ago, when I first started, it was so d=
ifficult to get people online.&nbsp; But now it's very
 easy.&nbsp; But still -- so the operational infrastructure is not there ye=
t, so we need to learn it from successful companies like Amazon, or we need=
 to come up with our own solution in Vietnam.&nbsp; Because the industry in=
 Vietnam is not the same as the U.S.&nbsp; You
 understand, right?&nbsp; So we have all the deliverymen on motorbike.&nbsp=
; And they have to know their way around.&nbsp; It's very difficult to inst=
all GPS.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; An=
d just one last question.&nbsp; In terms of access to capital, typically, a=
re startups here self-financed, or are they financed through the banks?&nbs=
p; Is there enough of sort of a bank infrastructure
 for small businesses and medium-sized businesses?&nbsp; Or are you using -=
- are most entrepreneurs using family savings?&nbsp; Is there venture capit=
al?&nbsp; How are people getting started?<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">VY:&nbsp; That's a very g=
ood question.&nbsp; To be honest, I think in Vietnam, it's very difficult t=
o get early funding.&nbsp; Especially there=92s not that many venture capit=
al funding here in Vietnam.&nbsp; For seed funding and investors,
 very limited.&nbsp; I think most of the investors in Vietnam, they want to=
 invest in companies that have track records, which is quite a challenge fo=
r a startup in Vietnam.&nbsp; So we have family startup here.&nbsp; It's go=
od news for us. And we hope that in the near future,
 more venture funds can come to Vietnam, especially from America, to help u=
s grow all of the new businesses.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; We=
ll, I'm trying to do some advertising for you here.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;=
 Hopefully somebody is paying attention back in the United States.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, Hang, you were talkin=
g about agriculture.&nbsp; Obviously a large portion of Vietnam is still de=
pendent on basic agricultural and small farmers.&nbsp; Is the goal here for=
 them to be able to move their products to market
 at a better price and more quickly?&nbsp; Or is it that you want to move u=
p the value chain so that there=92s more processing that's taking place, so=
 it's not just rice or other crops, but it's also the products that are der=
ived from the foodstuffs that are being
 grown?&nbsp; Or is it all of the above?&nbsp; Tell me a little bit more ab=
out how you see the opportunity for agriculture to accelerate here in Vietn=
am.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">HANG:&nbsp; I guess all o=
f the above.&nbsp; Of course, myself, we cannot change the (inaudible), but=
 many investors and entrepreneurs working together, we can make an impact.&=
nbsp; So as I mentioned, there are two partners in
 our business.&nbsp; One is to apply more technology.&nbsp; Some technology=
 is just very, very simple.&nbsp; You can text message.&nbsp; You can (inau=
dible) on the farm, et cetera.&nbsp; That improves the productivity massive=
ly, and that helps the farmers to increase their output and,
 as a result, their income.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=
sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And secondly, basically, ha=
ve a trust and more value and bring the products to the end users at a high=
er price.&nbsp; And obviously the result of that is also higher income.&nbs=
p; And we understand that there are a lot of challenges like you
 mentioned. Logistically, it's not there yet.&nbsp; The infrastructure, the=
re is a lot to do.&nbsp; But we are a very young team and they are farmers =
and they have a lot of -- I know personally a lot of people, young people w=
ho work in agriculture.&nbsp; And we have so much
 passion and energy and drive, and beyond that, we even have a strategy and=
 action plan to make this happen.&nbsp; So hopefully, in the next few years=
 you see some very positive change in agriculture in Vietnam.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; So, =
Pham, when you think about business here versus business as you're accustom=
ed to seeing in the United States, what are some of the big differences?&nb=
sp; And are there particular areas where you think a strategic investment
 would make a big difference in helping all these startups take off?&nbsp; =
And in terms of Microsoft=92s strategy, are your main clients large busines=
ses, and just helping them with respect to IT, or are you also working with=
 some of these smaller startups to see
 how you can grow their businesses and hopefully help them really take off?=
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PHAM:&nbsp; I'm sure you ha=
ve heard from -- our CO.&nbsp; Our company mission is to empower every pers=
on, every organization on the planet to achieve more.&nbsp; And I think the=
re is no better market to do that than in Vietnam, because of the young
 entrepreneurs that we have here and the penetration, the mobile base that =
we have here with young people.&nbsp; And I think that in terms of capturin=
g the opportunity, I think that's important for us to look at -- for our go=
vernment -- and businesses and entrepreneurs
 to really balance the opportunity and the responsibility in this new world=
 that we live in, which is a mobile world.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so if we look at the ch=
allenges in that respect, I think public policy, regulatory environment -- =
it needs to be more conducive, it needs to be modernized to address the dig=
ital economy.&nbsp; And I think that Vietnam is not unique
 in that space of the developing market.&nbsp; I think in the U.S. that the=
 same things have been faced with how do we deal with e-commerce across bor=
ders, taxation issues and things of that nature.&nbsp; But I think that Vie=
tnam can (inaudible) other markets, and seeing
 and capturing that opportunity.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Microsoft Vietnam, in p=
articular, we have a national empowerment plan that basically mirrors the g=
overnment ICT master plan by 2020 to really develop Vietnam in ICT advanced=
 nation.&nbsp; And so, in that regard, we look at the three
 key pillars, which is the ICT infrastructure of a country, helping really =
secure the cybersecurity apparatus of the country, really looking at the is=
sue of privacy with the protection of the ICT infrastructure for a national=
 cloud -- to really take advantage
 of that.&nbsp; <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And also our investment, =
in the second pillar, which is about small and medium-sized enterprises -- =
I think that is going to be the driving factor for the economic growth in t=
his country. We have about 500,000 businesses
 here of that size, and so I would say that the startup community is also t=
he micro businesses that are starting out.&nbsp; And we have programs that =
provide free software, free cloud services to these startups.&nbsp; So this=
 way, they can really focus on developing
 the best products.&nbsp; <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And then, honestly, the e=
ducation side, we really have to look at capacity building, and that is to =
really help the Vietnamese move from a labor-intensive economy into more of=
 a knowledge economy, knowledge-based
 economy.&nbsp; And that is really getting them the right skill set for ICT=
 skill set and also we need to really invest a bit more on STEM education.&=
nbsp; And we're doing that -- and teaching the technology in the classrooms=
, and really doing a lot of these startup
 community, coworking space, community events to really promote coding, bec=
ause I think that's very important.&nbsp; And I think (inaudible) -- I thin=
k that's something we do here annually as well.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; I =
think that's a great point, and, Vy and Hang, maybe you want to talk about =
this a little bit.&nbsp; Ultimately, what makes startups and entrepreneurs =
successful is good ideas and the human capital.&nbsp;
 Obviously investors are important and infrastructure is important, but the=
 most important thing is people.&nbsp; And when you look at Vietnam right n=
ow, it seems as if a culture of entrepreneurship is really beginning to gro=
w.&nbsp; But one of the questions that I always
 have to ask myself in the United States is whether our education system is=
 equipping our children effectively enough to be able to move forward on th=
eir ideas.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So you're both very young=
, so you can still remember what it's like to go to school.&nbsp; (Laughter=
.)&nbsp; For me, I've forgotten. But I will say that when I was going to sc=
hool we didn=92t have computers.&nbsp; Well, you had
 these big mainframe computers, but you didn=92t have personal computers.&n=
bsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">How do you see the educat=
ion system here adapting to the needs of this new 21st century economy?<p><=
/p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">VY:&nbsp; I still remembe=
r taking entrepreneurship classes in the U.S. and I found it so helpful for=
 me to learn about how to write a business plan, how to pitch to an investo=
r -- and I think when I got back here, I
 don't find many entrepreneurship classes in Vietnam.&nbsp; So I think that=
's an empty area that we can tap on.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And secondly, I think aft=
er the startup gets funding, I think they also need mentorship program.&nbs=
p; Those are the things that really helps the startup community in Vietnam.=
&nbsp; And I also think that -- I used to be an
 exchange student.&nbsp; I came to U.S. when I was 17.&nbsp; I'm very thank=
ful for that because I learned so much about innovation and I learned how t=
o dream big and always hope for a brighter future.&nbsp; So I think there=
=92s a chance for us to also create exchange programs,
 not just for students but for working adults.&nbsp; Especially we can send=
 young startups to do on-the-job training or internship program at some U.S=
. company.&nbsp; So those are the things that I really want to get to the a=
udience.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Go=
od.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Hang?<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">HANG:&nbsp; I'd like to a=
dd to what Vy just said -- the power of technology.&nbsp; Again, I go back =
to this.&nbsp; Students now, they have access to a lot more information, an=
d education opens new sector for startups to come and
 basically (inaudible.)&nbsp; So a friend, he has a education startup.&nbsp=
; Another friend who I know very well, she launched a startup that helps st=
udents learn English through an app.&nbsp; So all of those examples you can=
 see that technology basically opens the door and
 opens opportunities for Vietnamese students to access global knowledge.<p>=
</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the evidence of that =
is most of the teams that I work with in Vietnam for my previous startup --=
 they all are educated in Vietnam.&nbsp; I'm one of the very lucky few that=
 got years of education in the States.&nbsp; But
 I respect my colleagues a lot every day -- they=92re so smart.&nbsp; They =
learn in Vietnam.&nbsp; They learn not only by going to school, but also by=
 doing, by talking to older people, and obviously learning from the Interne=
t.&nbsp; So I do think technology is changing education.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; We=
ll, Pham was talking about leapfrogging. One of the things that you're seei=
ng in countries all around the world is if they haven't already developed a=
 telephone infrastructure with landlines
 and telephone poles and underground tunnels, now, suddenly, they just go s=
traight to cellular towers and smartphones.&nbsp; And banking is done there=
, and commerce is done through phones.&nbsp; And so they=92ve leapfrogged o=
ver the infrastructure requirements of both
 systems.&nbsp; <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the same is true with=
 education.&nbsp; If done properly, the opportunity for online education th=
at is much cheaper but is still of high quality that can accelerate the abi=
lity of a child here in Vietnam to learn
 coding, learn business practices and so forth, without an expensive educat=
ion or having to study overseas is hugely important.&nbsp; And with our con=
tribution through the Peace Corps, through entrepreneurship summits, throug=
h the sponsorships that we're getting
 various companies to engage in, our hope is, is that we'll be able to prov=
ide the kind of training to young people that will be incredibly powerful f=
or them in the future.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And we want to thank the =
Vietnamese government for their cooperation, because a lot of these systems=
 that we're trying to build we could not do if it were not for the strong s=
upport that we're receiving from them.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But any other closing tho=
ughts that you think either the President of the United States or the Presi=
dent of Vietnam or any of these business leaders here should hear about?<p>=
</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. P=
resident, let me ask you a question.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Oh, =
sure.&nbsp; The tide is turned.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So when=
 you were a kid, did you dream of becoming President one day?<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; No.&=
nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I think there are some people who they had a very c=
lear vision for themselves.&nbsp; I really didn=92t -- I was not as well or=
ganized as all of you when I was young.&nbsp; I think it wasn=92t until I w=
as in college
 that I began to develop a sense of wanting to make a difference.&nbsp; And=
 even then I did not know exactly how I might do it.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I was actually very skept=
ical of politics because I thought politicians weren=92t always looking out=
 for the people; that too often, I thought, they were looking out for thems=
elves.&nbsp; So I actually worked in communities
 to try to hold politicians accountable.&nbsp; That was the first job that =
I did in the nonprofit sector.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So it wasn=92t really unt=
il I think I finished law school that I thought that I might be interested =
in public service.&nbsp; In fact, I went to law school with my now who is m=
y Trade Representative, our Ambassador Michael
 Froman.&nbsp; And he was much smarter than me. (Laughter.)&nbsp; But it wa=
sn=92t until I came out of law school that I thought that maybe I might run=
 for office at some point.
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But the important point I=
 think I want to make is that so many of the young people here today -- cer=
tainly all of you -- well, you sort of qualify as young.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&=
nbsp; Young at heart. (Laughter.)&nbsp; These two are
 young.&nbsp; You're younger than me.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But so many o=
f the young people I meet today I think have a different idea of their care=
ers and their lives.&nbsp; I think they=92re much more sophisticated.&nbsp;=
 I think the Internet has exposed them to a lot more ideas
 of what they can do.&nbsp; I believe that many young people recognize that=
 the old system where you find yourself a job and then you work in that sam=
e job for 30 or 40 years is less likely to be the path for them because the=
 economy is just changing so quickly.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And so I think there=92s =
much more interest on the part of all the young people I meet -- certainly =
here in Southeast Asia, in the States, Africa, Europe, wherever I go -- to =
try to make it on their own, and to try
 to find collaborations with groups of people who are interested in the sam=
e things they are, and to see if they can make it happen.&nbsp; And I think=
 that's a wonderful thing.&nbsp; It's challenging.&nbsp; I think one of the=
 well-known rules in Silicon Valley is, is that
 if you haven't failed quite a bit then you're probably not a very good ent=
repreneur because the first idea you have is not always going to work.&nbsp=
; And you have to be resilient and be able to learn from your failures as m=
uch as your successes.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But I truly believe that =
this generation is not only being entrepreneurial when it thinks about busi=
ness, but also entrepreneurial when it thinks about trying to solve social =
problems; entrepreneurial when it thinks
 about government and making government more responsive and accountable to =
ordinary people.&nbsp; And it makes me very hopeful for the future.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gue=
ss the entrepreneurial spirit is very much engrained in Vietnamese people, =
just like for Americans.&nbsp; And you have seen, and just now have seen he=
re the very vibrant startup business community here in Ho
 Chi Minh City.&nbsp; Just imagine how much more it can be if there is more=
 exchange, of knowledge, of capital, technical know-how between the two cou=
ntries, the U.S. and Vietnam.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And on that note, my ques=
tion for you would be, if your daughter took a gap year from Harvard Colleg=
e, so tells you next week that she wants to live in Vietnam for a year, wha=
t would you tell her?<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Oh=
, I would encourage it.&nbsp; But what I've learned is, is that -- my daugh=
ter Malia will be 18 next month, and she already doesn=92t listen to me, wh=
atever I say.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; So if you want her to
 come to Vietnam, I shouldn=92t be the one to tell her.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&n=
bsp; Maybe you should tell her. Yes, absolutely.&nbsp; But certainly I woul=
d recommend students from the States to come and study here as much as I'm =
encouraging Vietnamese students to come and study
 in the United States.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Young people are going to=
 be living in an interconnected world, in a global marketplace.&nbsp; And e=
very business has to think globally.&nbsp; Even small businesses.&nbsp; If =
you have a good product today, you can reach billions
 of people if you have a good strategy, you have good marketing, you can ha=
ndle the logistics. And so the barriers to entry that used to exist where o=
nly a Boeing or a GE or a very large company could operate in Vietnam is no=
 longer true.&nbsp; And the same is true
 for small businesses here in Vietnam.&nbsp; If you have an interesting pro=
duct that is unique and perhaps is very common in Vietnam, but nobody knows=
 about in the United States, oftentimes some of the best ways to start a bu=
siness is to take something that is very
 popular in one place but is unknown someplace else and be the first person=
 to sell that product in another country.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I think part of the ed=
ucation that young people have to have is to understand other cultures and =
understand other markets.&nbsp; If you're lucky enough to be able to travel=
, then that's one way to do it.&nbsp; But one
 of the wonderful things about the Internet is it gives you an opportunity =
to learn about another place, even if you can't set foot there.&nbsp; So th=
at's something that I continually emphasize.
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Last question or comment.=
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PHAM:&nbsp; I have a ques=
tion.&nbsp; In your opening remarks, you mentioned about TPP, and we didn=
=92t have a chance to talk about that.&nbsp; And so TPP is considered a 21s=
t century trade agreement, dealing directly with the digital
 economy, talking about the rules of law extending to security and privacy =
and also cost more (inaudible.)&nbsp; TPP is very important to Vietnam, and=
 I know that the Vietnamese business community supports it.&nbsp; And as an=
 employee of Microsoft, I can reaffirm that
 our company supports TPP.&nbsp; <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">As we look at the latest =
report published by the U.S. International Trade Commission, that indicates=
 that, fully implemented, TPP will bring about $57 billion into the U.S. ec=
onomy.&nbsp; But apparently, the U.S. --
 American politics is sort of turning against TPP.&nbsp; So I'd like to hea=
r from you, what do you think is going to be -- what it takes to pass TPP i=
n Washington, D.C.&nbsp; And what will you do in your power to make that ha=
ppen?<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; We=
ll, it's a great question.&nbsp; And first of all, just to describe why TPP=
 is so important.&nbsp; What TPP does is it takes 12 countries along the As=
ia Pacific region that represent a huge portion of
 the entire world=92s marketplace, and it says we're going to create standa=
rds for trade and commerce that are fair; that create a level playing field=
; that have high standards; that encourage rule of law; that encourage prot=
ection of intellectual property --
 so if Vy or Hang come up with a great idea, somebody is not just going to =
steal it off the Internet but the work that they=92ve put in is protected; =
that has strong environmental provisions so that countries can't just take =
advantage of no environmental protection
 to undercut competitors who are following more responsible environmental p=
ractices.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And not only do all the c=
ountries who are participating stand to gain from increased trade, but Viet=
nam, in particular, I think economists who have studied it believe would be=
 one of the biggest beneficiaries.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">From the United States=92=
 perspective, it's a common-sense thing to do because, frankly, our markets=
 are already more open than many of the markets of the countries that are s=
igning up.&nbsp; So Japan, for example, is
 able to sell a lot of cars in the United States but has a lot of problems =
importing beef from the United States.&nbsp; And what we've done is to make=
 sure that a lot of the tariffs that are currently being placed on U.S. exp=
orts and U.S. goods are reduced.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And so it will create a b=
etter environment for U.S. businesses -- particularly because of some of th=
e intellectual property protections, a lot of what we sell today are produc=
ts of our knowledge-based economy.&nbsp;
 And so it's a smart thing to do across the board.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, the problem in the U=
nited States around trade -- and this is not new.&nbsp; This has been true =
for the last 30 years -- is that some of the previous trade agreements did =
not have enforceable labor protections or
 environmental protections.&nbsp; I think when China came in to the WTO, it=
 was able to take advantage of the growing global supply chain, and a lot o=
f manufacturing shifted to China in a very visible way.&nbsp; So a lot of A=
mericans saw companies close and saw what
 they viewed as their jobs being exported to China.&nbsp; And some of that =
happened in Mexico, with NAFTA as well.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And so the perception was=
 that this is bad for U.S. workers and U.S. jobs.&nbsp; If you look at the =
data, then what is true is that some manufacturing jobs were lost as a cons=
equence of trade. On the other hand, other
 sectors of the economy improved significantly.&nbsp; And overall, it was g=
ood for the U.S. economy.&nbsp; But I think that in the design of some of t=
he oil trade deals and some of the mistakes that may have been made in the =
past, people became suspicious of trade and
 worried that if we do TPP, then the same pattern will repeat itself, and t=
he U.S. will lose more jobs.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">My argument is that if yo=
u're dissatisfied with the current trading arrangements where tariffs are p=
laced on U.S. goods but other goods are already coming into the U.S., why w=
ould you want to just maintain the status
 quo?&nbsp; Why not change it so that everybody is operating in a fair and =
transparent way?<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the good news is, is =
that the majority of Americans still believe in trade and still believe tha=
t it's good for our economy.&nbsp; The bad news is politics in the United S=
tates is not always -- how would I put it
 -- reasonable.&nbsp; That's the word I'm looking for.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nb=
sp; But I'm confident that we're going to be able to get it done because, i=
n the past when we negotiated trade deals, even though there=92s a lot of o=
pposition, at the end of the day we end up getting
 it done.&nbsp; Keep in mind that we negotiated a very big free trade agree=
ment with Korea, and even though the Bush administration negotiated it, he =
didn=92t get it passed, when I came into office, one of the first things we=
 did was we worked with Korea, we made
 some small modifications to some of the terms and we got it done, and it's=
 in force today.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the argument that I've=
 made and I will continue to make in the United States is that we're not go=
ing to be able to end globalization.&nbsp; We have to make globalization wo=
rk for us.&nbsp; And that means that we don't
 try to put barriers and walls between us and the rest of the world; but in=
stead, we try to make sure that the world has high standards, treats our co=
mpanies fairly.&nbsp; And if we do that, I'm confident we can compete with =
anybody.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So nothing is easy in Was=
hington these days.&nbsp; But despite sometimes the lack of cooperation wit=
h Congress, I seem to be able to get a lot of things done anyway.&nbsp; (La=
ughter.)&nbsp; It could have been easier.&nbsp; I would
 have less gray hair -- (laughter) -- if Congress was working more effectiv=
ely, but we do have some members of Congress who are here.&nbsp; That's Con=
gressman Castro and Congressman O=92Rourke who are two outstanding young co=
ngressmen from Texas.&nbsp; They=92re strong TPP
 supporters and we're very proud of the work that they=92ve done.&nbsp; So =
we're just going to have to work hard to convince some of their colleagues.=
&nbsp; But ultimately I think we can get it passed.
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Well, everybody, I think =
that if you have any doubt about the outstanding future of Vietnamese entre=
preneurs, then all those doubts have been pushed away because of the outsta=
nding presentations by these three individuals.&nbsp;
 Give them a big round of applause.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
