REMARKS BY PRESIDENT OBAMA

IN ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF VIETNAM

=C2=A0

National Convention Center

Hanoi, Vietnam

=C2=A0

=C2=A0

=C2=A0

12:11 P.M. ICT

=C2=A0

PRESIDENT OBAMA:=C2=A0 Xin ch=C3=A0o!=C2=A0 (Applause.)=C2=A0 Xin ch=C3=A0=
o Vietnam!=C2=A0 (Applause.)=C2=A0 Thank you.=C2=A0 Thank you so much.=C2=
=A0 To the government and the people of Vietnam, thank you for this very =
warm welcome and the hospitality that you have shown to me on this visit.=
=C2=A0 And thank all of you for being here today.=C2=A0 (Applause.)=C2=A0=
=C2=A0 We have Vietnamese from across this great country, including so ma=
ny young people who represent the dynamism, and the talent and the hope o=
f Vietnam.=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

On this visit, my heart has been touched by the kindness for which the Vi=
etnamese people are known.=C2=A0 In the many people who have been lining =
the streets, smiling and waving, I feel the friendship between our people=
s.=C2=A0 Last night, I visited the Old Quarter here in Hanoi and enjoyed =
some outstanding Vietnamese food.=C2=A0 I tried some B=C3=BAn Ch=E1=BA=A3=
.=C2=A0 (Applause.)=C2=A0 Drank some bia Ha Noi.=C2=A0 But I have to say,=
 the busy streets of this city, I=E2=80=99ve never seen so many motorbike=
s in my life.=C2=A0 (Laughter.)=C2=A0 So I haven=E2=80=99t had to try to =
cross the street so far, but maybe when I come back and visit you can tel=
l me how.=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

I am not the first American President to come to Vietnam in recent times.=
=C2=A0 But I am the first, like so many of you, who came of age after the=
 war between our countries.=C2=A0 When the last U.S. forces left Vietnam,=
 I was just 13 years old.=C2=A0 So my first exposure to Vietnam and the V=
ietnamese people came when I was growing up in Hawaii, with its proud Vie=
tnamese American community there.

=C2=A0

At the same time, many people in this country are much younger than me.=C2=
=A0 Like my two daughters, many of you have lived your whole lives knowin=
g only one thing -- and that is peace and normalized relations between Vi=
etnam and the United States.=C2=A0 So I come here mindful of the past, mi=
ndful of our difficult history, but focused on the future -- the prosperi=
ty, security and human dignity that we can advance together.

=C2=A0

I also come here with a deep respect for Vietnam=E2=80=99s ancient herita=
ge.=C2=A0 For millennia, farmers have tended these lands -- a history rev=
ealed in the Dong Son drums.=C2=A0 At this bend in the river, Hanoi has e=
ndured for more than a thousand years.=C2=A0 The world came to treasure V=
ietnamese silks and paintings, and a great Temple of Literature stands as=
 a testament to your pursuit of knowledge.=C2=A0 And yet, over the centur=
ies, your fate was too often dictated by others.=C2=A0 Your beloved land =
was not always your own.=C2=A0 But like bamboo, the unbroken spirit of th=
e Vietnamese people was captured by Ly Thuong Kiet -- =E2=80=9Cthe Southe=
rn emperor rules the Southern land.=C2=A0 Our destiny is writ in Heaven=E2=
=80=99s Book.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

Today, we also remember the longer history between Vietnamese and America=
ns that is too often overlooked.=C2=A0 More than 200 years ago, when our =
Founding Father, Thomas Jefferson, sought rice for his farm, he looked to=
 the rice of Vietnam, which he said had =E2=80=9Cthe reputation of being =
whitest to the eye, best flavored to the taste, and most productive.=E2=80=
=9D=C2=A0 Soon after, American trade ships arrived in your ports seeking =
commerce.=C2=A0=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0

During the Second World War, Americans came here to support your struggle=
 against occupation.=C2=A0 When American pilots were shot down, the Vietn=
amese people helped rescue them.=C2=A0 And on the day that Vietnam declar=
ed its independence, crowds took to the streets of this city, and Ho Chi =
Minh evoked the American Declaration of Independence.=C2=A0 He said, =E2=80=
=9CAll people are created equal.=C2=A0 The Creator has endowed them with =
inviolable rights.=C2=A0 Among these rights are the right to life, the ri=
ght to liberty, and the right to the pursuit of happiness.=E2=80=9D

=C2=A0

In another time, the profession of these shared ideals and our common sto=
ry of throwing off colonialism might have brought us closer together soon=
er.=C2=A0 But instead, Cold War rivalries and fears of communism pulled u=
s into conflict.=C2=A0 Like other conflicts throughout human history, we =
learned once more a bitter truth -- that war, no matter what our intentio=
ns may be, brings suffering and tragedy.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

At your war memorial not far from here, and with family altars across thi=
s country, you remember some 3 million Vietnamese, soldiers and civilians=
, on both sides, who lost their lives.=C2=A0 At our memorial wall in Wash=
ington, we can touch the names of 58,315 Americans who gave their lives i=
n the conflict.=C2=A0 In both our countries, our veterans and families of=
 the fallen still ache for the friends and loved ones that they lost.=C2=A0=
 Just as we learned in America that, even if we disagree about a war, we =
must always honor those who serve and welcome them home with the respect =
they deserve, we can join together today, Vietnamese and Americans, and a=
cknowledge the pain and the sacrifices on both sides.

=C2=A0

More recently, over the past two decades, Vietnam has achieved enormous p=
rogress, and today the world can see the strides that you have made.=C2=A0=
 With economic reforms and trade agreements, including with the United St=
ates, you have entered the global economy, selling your goods around the =
world.=C2=A0 More foreign investment is coming in.=C2=A0 And with one of =
the fastest-growing economies in Asia, Vietnam has moved up to become a m=
iddle-income nation.

=C2=A0

We see Vietnam=E2=80=99s progress in the skyscrapers and high-rises of Ha=
noi and Ho Chi Minh City, and new shopping malls and urban centers.=C2=A0=
 We see it in the satellites Vietnam puts into space and a new generation=
 that is online, launching startups and running new ventures.=C2=A0 We se=
e it in the tens of millions of Vietnamese connected on Facebook and Inst=
agram.=C2=A0 And you=E2=80=99re not just posting selfies -- although I he=
ar you do that a lot -- (laughter) -- and so far, there have been a numbe=
r of people who have already asked me for selfies.=C2=A0 You=E2=80=99re a=
lso raising your voices for causes that you care about, like saving the o=
ld trees of Hanoi.

=C2=A0

So all this dynamism has delivered real progress in people=E2=80=99s live=
s.=C2=A0 Here in Vietnam, you=E2=80=99ve dramatically reduced extreme pov=
erty, you've boosted family incomes and lifted millions into a fast-growi=
ng middle class.=C2=A0 Hunger, disease, child and maternal mortality are =
all down.=C2=A0 The number of people with clean drinking water and electr=
icity, the number of boys and girls in school, and your literacy rate -- =
these are all up.=C2=A0 This is extraordinary progress.=C2=A0 This is wha=
t you have been able to achieve in a very short time.

=C2=A0

And as Vietnam has transformed, so has the relationship between our two n=
ations.=C2=A0 We learned a lesson taught by the venerable Thich Nhat Hanh=
, who said, =E2=80=9CIn true dialogue, both sides are willing to change.=E2=
=80=9D=C2=A0 In this way, the very war that had divided us became a sourc=
e for healing. =C2=A0It allowed us to account for the missing and finally=
 bring them home.=C2=A0 It allowed us to help remove landmines and unexpl=
oded bombs, because no child should ever lose a leg just playing outside.=
=C2=A0 Even as we continue to assist Vietnamese with disabilities, includ=
ing children, we are also continuing to help remove Agent Orange -- dioxi=
n -- so that Vietnam can reclaim more of your land.=C2=A0 We're proud of =
our work together in Danang, and we look forward to supporting your effor=
ts in Bien Hoa.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

Let=E2=80=99s also not forget that the reconciliation between our countri=
es was led by our veterans who once faced each other in battle.=C2=A0 Thi=
nk of Senator John McCain, who was held for years here as a prisoner of w=
ar, meeting General Giap, who said our countries should not be enemies bu=
t friends.=C2=A0 Think of all the veterans, Vietnamese and American, who =
have helped us heal and build new ties.=C2=A0 Few have done more in this =
regard over the years than former Navy lieutenant, and now Secretary of S=
tate of the United States, John Kerry, who is here today.=C2=A0 And on be=
half of all of us, John, we thank you for your extraordinary effort.=C2=A0=
 (Applause.)=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

Because our veterans showed us the way, because warriors had the courage =
to pursue peace, our peoples are now closer than ever before.=C2=A0 Our t=
rade has surged.=C2=A0 Our students and scholars learn together.=C2=A0 We=
 welcome more Vietnamese students to America than from any other country =
in Southeast Asia.=C2=A0 And every year, you welcome more and more Americ=
an tourists, including young Americans with their backpacks, to Hanoi=E2=80=
=99s 36 Streets and the shops of Hoi An, and the imperial city of Hue.=C2=
=A0 As Vietnamese and Americans, we can all relate to those words written=
 by Van Cao -- =E2=80=9CFrom now, we know each other=E2=80=99s homeland; =
from now, we learn to feel for each other.=E2=80=9D

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20

As President, I=E2=80=99ve built on this progress.=C2=A0 With our new Com=
prehensive Partnership, our governments are working more closely together=
 than ever before.=C2=A0 And with this visit, we=E2=80=99ve put our relat=
ionship on a firmer footing for decades to come.=C2=A0 In a sense, the lo=
ng story between our two nations that began with Thomas Jefferson more th=
an two centuries ago has now come full circle.=C2=A0 It has taken many ye=
ars and required great effort.=C2=A0 But now we can say something that wa=
s once unimaginable:=C2=A0 Today, Vietnam and the United States are partn=
ers.=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

And I believe our experience holds lessons for the world.=C2=A0 At a time=
 when many conflicts seem intractable, seem as if they will never end, we=
 have shown that hearts can change and that a different future is possibl=
e when we refuse to be prisoners of the past.=C2=A0 We've shown how peace=
 can be better than war.=C2=A0 We've shown that progress and human dignit=
y is best advanced by cooperation and not conflict.=C2=A0 That=E2=80=99s =
what Vietnam and America can show the world.=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

Now, America=E2=80=99s new partnership with Vietnam is rooted in some bas=
ic truths.=C2=A0 Vietnam is an independent, sovereign nation, and no othe=
r nation can impose its will on you or decide your destiny.=C2=A0 (Applau=
se.)=C2=A0 Now, the United States has an interest here.=C2=A0 We have an =
interest in Vietnam=E2=80=99s success.=C2=A0 But our Comprehensive Partne=
rship is still in its early stages.=C2=A0 And with the time I have left, =
I want to share with you the vision that I believe can guide us in the de=
cades ahead.=20

=C2=A0

First, let=E2=80=99s work together to create real opportunity and prosper=
ity for all of our people.=C2=A0 We know the ingredients for economic suc=
cess in the 21st century.=C2=A0 In our global economy, investment and tra=
de flows to wherever there is rule of law, because no one wants to pay a =
bribe to start a business.=C2=A0 Nobody wants to sell their goods or go t=
o school if they don=E2=80=99t know how they're going to be treated.=C2=A0=
 In knowledge-based economies, jobs go to where people have the freedom t=
o think for themselves and exchange ideas and to innovate.=C2=A0 And real=
 economic partnerships are not just about one country extracting resource=
s from another.=C2=A0 They=E2=80=99re about investing in our greatest res=
ource, which is our people and their skills and their talents, whether yo=
u live in a big city or a rural village.=C2=A0 And that=E2=80=99s the kin=
d of partnership that America offers.

=C2=A0

As I announced yesterday, the Peace Corps will come to Vietnam for the fi=
rst time, with a focus on teaching English.=C2=A0 A generation after youn=
g Americans came here to fight, a new generation of Americans are going t=
o come here to teach and build and deepen the friendship between us.=C2=A0=
 (Applause.)=C2=A0 Some of America=E2=80=99s leading technology companies=
 and academic institutions are joining Vietnamese universities to strengt=
hen training in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medici=
ne.=C2=A0 Because even as we keep welcoming more Vietnamese students to A=
merica, we also believe that young people deserve a world-class education=
 right here in Vietnam.=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

It's one of the reasons why we're very excited that this fall, the new Fu=
lbright University Vietnam will open in Ho Chi Minh City -- this nation=E2=
=80=99s first independent, non-profit university -- where there will be f=
ull academic freedom and scholarships for those in need.=C2=A0 (Applause.=
)=C2=A0 Students, scholars, researchers will focus on public policy and m=
anagement and business; on engineering and computer science; and liberal =
arts -- everything from the poetry of Nguyen Du, to the philosophy of Pha=
n Chu Trinh, to the mathematics of Ngo Bao Chau.=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

And we're going to keep partnering with young people and entrepreneurs, b=
ecause we believe that if you can just access the skills and technology a=
nd capital you need, then nothing can stand in your way -- and that inclu=
des, by the way, the talented women of Vietnam.=C2=A0 (Applause.)=C2=A0 W=
e think gender equality is an important principle.=C2=A0 From the Trung S=
isters to today, strong, confident women have always helped move Vietnam =
forward.=C2=A0 The evidence is clear -- I say this wherever I go around t=
he world -- families, communities and countries are more prosperous when =
girls and women have an equal opportunity to succeed in school and at wor=
k and in government.=C2=A0 That's true everywhere, and it's true here in =
Vietnam.=C2=A0 (Applause.)=20

=C2=A0

We=E2=80=99ll keep working to unleash the full potential of your economy =
with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.=C2=A0 Here in Vietnam, TPP will let y=
ou sell more of your products to the world and it will attract new invest=
ment.=C2=A0 TPP will require reforms to protect workers and rule of law a=
nd intellectual property.=C2=A0 And the United States is ready to assist =
Vietnam as it works to fully implement its commitments.=C2=A0 I want you =
to know that, as President of the United States, I strongly support TPP b=
ecause you'll also be able to buy more of our goods, =E2=80=9CMade in Ame=
rica.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

Moreover, I support TPP because of its important strategic benefits.=C2=A0=
 Vietnam will be less dependent on any one trading partner and enjoy broa=
der ties with more partners, including the United States.=C2=A0 (Applause=
.)=C2=A0 And TPP will reinforce regional cooperation.=C2=A0 It will help =
address economic inequality and will advance human rights, with higher wa=
ges and safer working conditions.=C2=A0 For the first time here in Vietna=
m, the right to form independent labor unions and prohibitions against fo=
rced labor and child labor.=C2=A0 And it has the strongest environmental =
protections and the strongest anti-corruption standards of any trade agre=
ement in history.=C2=A0 That=E2=80=99s the future TPP offers for all of u=
s, because all of us -- the United States, Vietnam, and the other signato=
ries -- will have to abide by these rules that we have shaped together.=C2=
=A0 That's the future that is available to all of us.=C2=A0 So we now hav=
e to get it done -- for the sake of our economic prosperity and our natio=
nal security.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

This brings me to the second area where we can work together, and that is=
 ensuring our mutual security.=C2=A0 With this visit, we have agreed to e=
levate our security cooperation and build more trust between our men and =
women in uniform.=C2=A0 We=E2=80=99ll continue to offer training and equi=
pment to your Coast Guard to enhance Vietnam=E2=80=99s maritime capabilit=
ies.=C2=A0 We will partner to deliver humanitarian aid in times of disast=
er.=C2=A0 With the announcement I made yesterday to fully lift the ban on=
 defense sales, Vietnam will have greater access to the military equipmen=
t you need to ensure your security.=C2=A0 And the United States is demons=
trating our commitment to fully normalize our relationship with Vietnam.=C2=
=A0 (Applause.)=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

More broadly, the 20th century has taught all of us -- including the Unit=
ed States and Vietnam -- that the international order upon which our mutu=
al security depends is rooted in certain rules and norms.=C2=A0 Nations a=
re sovereign, and no matter how large or small a nation may be, its sover=
eignty should be respected, and it territory should not be violated.=C2=A0=
 Big nations should not bully smaller ones.=C2=A0 Disputes should be reso=
lved peacefully.=C2=A0 (Applause.)=C2=A0 And regional institutions, like =
ASEAN and the East Asia Summit, should continue to be strengthened.=C2=A0=
 That=E2=80=99s what I believe.=C2=A0 That's what the United States belie=
ves.=C2=A0 That=E2=80=99s the kind of partnership America offers this reg=
ion.=C2=A0 I look forward to advancing this spirit of respect and reconci=
liation later this year when I become the first U.S. President to visit L=
aos.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

In the South China Sea, the United States is not a claimant in current di=
sputes.=C2=A0 But we will stand with partners in upholding core principle=
s, like freedom of navigation and overflight, and lawful commerce that is=
 not impeded, and the peaceful resolution of disputes, through legal mean=
s, in accordance with international law.=C2=A0 As we go forward, the Unit=
ed States will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international l=
aw allows, and we will support the right of all countries to do the same.=
=C2=A0 (Applause.)=20

=C2=A0

Even as we cooperate more closely in the areas I=E2=80=99ve described, ou=
r partnership includes a third element -- addressing areas where our gove=
rnments disagree, including on human rights.=C2=A0 I say this not to sing=
le out Vietnam.=C2=A0 No nation is perfect.=C2=A0 Two centuries on, the U=
nited States is still striving to live up to our founding ideals.=C2=A0 W=
e still deal with our shortcomings -- too much money in our politics, and=
 rising economic inequality, racial bias in our criminal justice system, =
women still not being paid as much as men doing the same job.=C2=A0 We st=
ill have problems.=C2=A0 And we're not immune from criticism, I promise y=
ou.=C2=A0 I hear it every day.=C2=A0 But that scrutiny, that open debate,=
 confronting our imperfections, and allowing everybody to have their say =
has helped us grow stronger and more prosperous and more just.

=C2=A0

I=E2=80=99ve said this before -- the United States does not seek to impos=
e our form of government on Vietnam.=C2=A0 The rights I speak of I believ=
e are not American values; I think they're universal values written into =
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.=C2=A0 They're written into the=
 Vietnamese constitution, which states that =E2=80=9Ccitizens have the ri=
ght to freedom of speech and freedom of the press, and have the right of =
access to information, the right to assembly, the right to association, a=
nd the right to demonstrate.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0 That=E2=80=99s in the Vietnam=
ese constitution.=C2=A0 (Applause.)=C2=A0 So really, this is an issue abo=
ut all of us, each country, trying to consistently apply these principles=
, making sure that we -- those of us in government -- are being true to t=
hese ideals.=C2=A0=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

In recent years, Vietnam has made some progress.=C2=A0 Vietnam has commit=
ted to bringing its laws in line with its new constitution and with inter=
national norms.=C2=A0 Under recently passed laws, the government will dis=
close more of its budget and the public will have the right to access mor=
e information.=C2=A0 And, as I said, Vietnam has committed to economic an=
d labor reforms under the TPP.=C2=A0=C2=A0 So these are all positive step=
s.=C2=A0 And ultimately, the future of Vietnam will be decided by the peo=
ple of Vietnam.=C2=A0 Every country will chart its own path, and our two =
nations have different traditions and different political systems and dif=
ferent cultures.=C2=A0 But as a friend of Vietnam, allow me to share my v=
iew -- why I believe nations are more successful when universal rights ar=
e upheld.

=C2=A0

When there is freedom of expression and freedom of speech, and when peopl=
e can share ideas and access the Internet and social media without restri=
ction, that fuels the innovation economies need to thrive.=C2=A0 That's w=
here new ideas happen.=C2=A0 That's how a Facebook starts.=C2=A0 That's h=
ow some of our greatest companies began -- because somebody had a new ide=
a.=C2=A0 It was different.=C2=A0 And they were able to share it.=C2=A0 Wh=
en there=E2=80=99s freedom of the press -- when journalists and bloggers =
are able to shine a light on injustice or abuse -- that holds officials a=
ccountable and builds public confidence that the system works.=C2=A0 When=
 candidates can run for office and campaign freely, and voters can choose=
 their own leaders in free and fair elections, it makes the countries mor=
e stable, because citizens know that their voices count and that peaceful=
 change is possible.=C2=A0 And it brings new people into the system.=C2=A0=
=20

=C2=A0

When there is freedom of religion, it not only allows people to fully exp=
ress the love and compassion that are at the heart of all great religions=
, but it allows faith groups to serve their communities through schools a=
nd hospitals, and care for the poor and the vulnerable.=C2=A0 And when th=
ere is freedom of assembly -- when citizens are free to organize in civil=
 society -- then countries can better address challenges that government =
sometimes cannot solve by itself.=C2=A0 So it is my view that upholding t=
hese rights is not a threat to stability, but actually reinforces stabili=
ty and is the foundation of progress.=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

After all, it was a yearning for these rights that inspired people around=
 the world, including Vietnam, to throw off colonialism.=C2=A0 And I beli=
eve that upholding these rights is the fullest expression of the independ=
ence that so many cherish, including here, in a nation that proclaims its=
elf to be =E2=80=9Cof the People, by the People and for the People.=E2=80=
=9D

=C2=A0

Vietnam will do it differently than the United States does.=C2=A0 And eac=
h of us will do it differently from many other countries around the world=
.=C2=A0 But there are these basic principles that I think we all have to =
try to work on and improve.=C2=A0 And I said this as somebody who's about=
 to leave office, so I have the benefit of almost eight years now of refl=
ecting on how our system has worked and interacting with countries around=
 the world who are constantly trying to improve their systems, as well.

=C2=A0

Finally, our partnership I think can meet global challenges that no natio=
n can solve by itself.=C2=A0 If we=E2=80=99re going to ensure the health =
of our people and the beauty of our planet, then development has to be su=
stainable.=C2=A0 Natural wonders like Ha Long Bay and Son Doong Cave have=
 to be preserved for our children and our grandchildren.=C2=A0 Rising sea=
s threaten the coasts and waterways on which so many Vietnamese depend.=C2=
=A0 And so as partners in the fight against climate change, we need to fu=
lfill the commitments we made in Paris, we need to help farmers and villa=
ges and people who depend on fishing to adapt and to bring more clean ene=
rgy to places like the Mekong Delta -- a rice bowl of the world that we n=
eed to feed future generations.

=C2=A0

And we can save lives beyond our borders.=C2=A0 By helping other countrie=
s strengthen, for example, their health systems, we can prevent outbreaks=
 of disease from becoming epidemics that threaten all of us.=C2=A0 And as=
 Vietnam deepens its commitment to U.N. peacekeeping, the United States i=
s proud to help train your peacekeepers.=C2=A0 And what a truly remarkabl=
e thing that is -- our two nations that once fought each other now standi=
ng together and helping others achieve peace, as well.=C2=A0 So in additi=
on to our bilateral relationship, our partnership also allows us to help =
shape the international environment in ways that are positive.=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

Now, fully realizing the vision that I=E2=80=99ve described today is not =
going to happen overnight, and it is not inevitable.=C2=A0 There may be s=
tumbles and setbacks along the way.=C2=A0 There are going to be times whe=
re there are misunderstandings.=C2=A0 It will take sustained effort and t=
rue dialogue where both sides continue to change.=C2=A0 But considering a=
ll the history and hurdles that we've already overcome, I stand before yo=
u today very optimistic about our future together.=C2=A0 (Applause.)=C2=A0=
 And my confidence is rooted, as always, in the friendship and shared asp=
irations of our peoples.

=C2=A0

I think of all the Americans and Vietnamese who have crossed a wide ocean=
 -- some reuniting with families for the first time in decades -- and who=
, like Trinh Cong Son said in his song, have joined hands, and opening th=
eir hearts and seeing our common humanity in each other.=C2=A0 (Applause.=
)=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

I think of all the Vietnamese Americans who have succeeded in every walk =
of life -- doctors, journalists, judges, public servants.=C2=A0 One of th=
em, who was born here, wrote me a letter and said, by =E2=80=9CGod=E2=80=99=
s grace, I have been able to live the American Dream=E2=80=A6I'm very pro=
ud to be an American but also very proud to be Vietnamese.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0=
 (Applause.)=C2=A0 And today he=E2=80=99s here, back in the country of hi=
s birth, because, he said, his =E2=80=9Cpersonal passion=E2=80=9D is =E2=80=
=9Cimproving the life of every Vietnamese person.=E2=80=9D

=C2=A0

I think of a new generation of Vietnamese -- so many of you, so many of t=
he young people who are here -- who are ready to make your mark on the wo=
rld.=C2=A0 And I want to say to all the young people listening:=C2=A0 You=
r talent, your drive, your dreams -- in those things, Vietnam has everyth=
ing it needs to thrive.=C2=A0 Your destiny is in your hands.=C2=A0 This i=
s your moment.=C2=A0 And as you pursue the future that you want, I want y=
ou to know that the United States of America will be right there with you=
 as your partner and as your friend.=C2=A0 (Applause.)=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

And many years from now, when even more Vietnamese and Americans are stud=
ying with each other; innovating and doing business with each other; stan=
ding up for our security, and promoting human rights and protecting our p=
lanet with each other -- I hope you think back to this moment and draw ho=
pe from the vision that I=E2=80=99ve offered today.=C2=A0 Or, if I can sa=
y it another way -- in words that you know well from the Tale of Kieu -- =
=E2=80=9CPlease take from me this token of trust, so we can embark upon o=
ur 100-year journey together.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0 (Applause.)=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=

kindness for which the Vietnamese people are known.&nbsp; In the many peopl=

 I feel the friendship between our peoples.&nbsp; Last night, I visited the=
 Old Quarter here in Hanoi and enjoyed some outstanding Vietnamese food.&nb=

 never seen so many motorbikes in my life.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; So I hav=

 Vietnam in recent times.&nbsp; But I am the first, like so many of you, wh=

 the last U.S. forces left Vietnam, I was just 13 years old.&nbsp; So my fi=

=E2=80=99s ancient heritage.&nbsp; For millennia, farmers have tended these=
 lands -- a history revealed in the Dong Son drums.&nbsp; At this
 bend in the river, Hanoi has endured for more than a thousand years.&nbsp;=
 The world came to treasure Vietnamese silks and paintings, and a great Tem=
ple of Literature stands as a testament to your pursuit of knowledge.&nbsp;=
 And yet, over the centuries, your fate was
 too often dictated by others.&nbsp; Your beloved land was not always your =

 sought rice for his farm, he looked to the rice of Vietnam, which he said =
had =E2=80=9C</span><span lang=3D"EN" style=3D"font-family:&quot;Courier Ne=

s how a Facebook starts.&nbsp; That's how some of our greatest companies be=

t the system works.&nbsp; When candidates can run for office and campaign f=

 leaders in free and fair elections, it makes the countries more stable, be=
cause citizens know that their voices count and that peaceful change is pos=
