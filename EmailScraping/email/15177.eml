PRESS BRIEFING

BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room=20



*Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.



1:05 P.M. EDT





 MR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. We have some brief comments befo=
re we get to your questions.=20



 In response to a specific request that I received yesterday for addition=
al information about the Zika virus, I also have a visual aid. You want t=
o put it up there. You can see --



 Q Is that for me?



 MR. EARNEST: It's for everybody, but it certainly is responsive to your =
request.=20



 Earlier this week, I highlighted the letter from the National Governors =
Association, urging Congress to work as expeditiously as possible to ensu=
re that funds are available for states, territories and the public at lar=
ge to combat the threat of Zika.=20



Many of you will recall that the President convened a meeting with some o=
f his national security team and our public health professionals back in =
January to discuss the potential impact of the Zika virus on the United S=
tates. That meeting led the President to note in early February that he i=
ntended to forward a formal request to Congress for a specific emergency =
supplemental legislation that would be focused on fighting the Zika virus=
.



A couple weeks later, in mid-February, the administration put forward tha=
t specific proposal to Congress. That is now almost three months ago. And=
 even though we had months to get ahead of this emergency, before we star=
t to see direct transmission of Zika by mosquitoes in the United States, =
Congress has not acted. Congress has basically done nothing to act on thi=
s specific request for funding that was put forward by the administration=
 and endorsed by Democratic and Republican governors across the country, =
and our nations foremost public health experts.



As you can see in the graphic behind me, the time to prepare before Zika =
begins to spread in the continental United States is rapidly closing. As =
CDC has said for months, based on historical trends, we expect to see tra=
nsmission of Zika from mosquitoes inside the United States starting in Ju=
ne or July. This graphic shows the expected abundance of this mosquito an=
d the significant increase in its presence over the summer months.



As you can clearly see, the threat from the Zika virus is only increasing=
. The truth is this is an emergency now, and Congress should treat it tha=
t way. We need emergency funding from Congress that allows us to take urg=
ent and immediate steps to limit the impact of the Zika virus.



What this graphic clearly shows is we cannot wait until October for the n=
ormal appropriation cycle before we confront this emergency. Action is ne=
eded from Congress now to provide necessary funding this year to protect =
pregnant women and their babies in the United States.



As you all are well aware, we've been asking Congress to take action sinc=
e we submitted an emergency budget request in February, and you have hear=
d from the foremost public health experts in the world about why we need =
this additional funding and why we need it now. We are working around the=
 clock. These public health professionals are working around the clock. S=
tate and local officials are working around the clock to protect the Amer=
ican public. Congress, however, just returned from recess two days ago, a=
nd given the threat that this virus poses to American mothers and their b=
abies, Congress should not leave town for another recess before sending a=
 Zika funding bill to the Presidents desk for his signature.



And I think the map behind me is a graphic illustration of the need for i=
mmediate congressional action. It also is an appropriate illustration for=
 why the current approach that's advocated by Republican leaders in Congr=
ess is woefully insufficient. Under the Republican plan that Republican l=
eaders have just started to discuss is that they may get around to passin=
g funding and approving funding for the Zika virus in October. Well, as y=
ou can see from the map that would be after the peak of the mosquito seas=
on. Theres a colloquial expression about closing the barn door after the =
horse has already left. I would be tempted to use that analogy in this si=
tuation if the situation werent so serious.



So we need some congressional action. We need a sense of urgency and we n=
eed it now.



So, with all that, Brad, welcome to the front row. We'll let you get star=
ted off with questions here.



Q So before we get back to Zika, I wanted to ask about reports of the Isl=
amic State forces advancing on the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra. That s=
eems to put you in an odd position. Are you hoping the Assad regime holds=
 the city?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have the latest battlefield assessment to offe=
r here. As we noted at the time, we obviously were pleased to see ISIL gi=
ve up Palmyra, and the focus of our efforts has been on degrading and ult=
imately destroying that terrorist organization. And we welcomed that deve=
lopment, and we certainly do not want to see ISIL expand the territory th=
at they control, and we certainly do not want to see ISIL put at risk onc=
e again such a historically and culturally significant city.



Q Given the threat of ISIS reconquering the city and gaining what would b=
e a major strategic victory, is this a situation where the U.S. could con=
ceivably coordinate with Russia, which has provided backup to Assad and i=
ndirectly to Assads military?



MR. EARNEST: Well, we have talked for quite some time about the efforts t=
hat are currently underway to de-conflict our military activities with Ru=
ssia in the skies over Iraq and in Syria. There have been a number of con=
sultations about that. But those consultations have stopped short of any =
sort of formal military cooperation, and I don't anticipate that that wil=
l change.



Q And I just wanted to ask you about Iraq. There have been three car bomb=
ings in the last 24 hours or so, over 90 people killed. Daesh is claiming=
 responsibility. Are you worried that Daesh is trying to shape Baghdad ag=
ain for a possible assault, as we saw about 18 months ago?=20



MR. EARNEST: Well, let me just start by saying that the United States str=
ongly condemns the multiple attacks in and around Baghdad today. Initial =
estimates project more than 80 Iraqi citizens have been killed in those a=
ttacks; many more have been injured. These attacks demonstrate the terror=
ists carry out these abominable attacks without regard to innocent civili=
an life and in order to stoke tensions between these communities even fur=
ther.=20



We reiterate our solidarity with the Iraqi people against the threat from=
 ISIL. ISIL is a common enemy to all Iraqis, Americans, and the 65 nation=
s who are part of our counter-ISIL coalition. By working together, the Ir=
aqi people have made important gains against ISIL since 2014, and every s=
tep the United States has taken is to support the Iraqi government and th=
e Iraqi people as they take back their country.



I think what is clear from this incident is that a lot of innocent people=
 have been killed and injured, and it certainly is consistent with ISILs =
strategy of wreaking havoc and sowing chaos and violence and sectarian te=
nsion. And in many cases, they do that by killing innocent people, by tar=
geting them specifically. Those tactics are abhorrent. And it is a good i=
llustration of exactly what the United States has rallied behind the Unit=
ed States to defeat.



Q And just lastly, are you worried that the Iraqi governments inability t=
o provide security in the capital is going to fuel the political instabil=
ity thats been going on and which has been hampering critical elements of=
 the anti-ISIL offensive such as the Mosul offensive?



MR. EARNEST: Well, what is clear is that the top priority of the Abadi go=
vernment is the national security of Iraq, and protecting the citizens of=
 Iraq from this sort of violence is the Abadi governments top priority. T=
he administration, the United States government has been of the strongly =
held view that the Iraqi government is more likely to be successful in se=
curing the country if they can succeed in uniting that country to face do=
wn the threat.=20



That's what Prime Minister Abadi has tried to do. He has worked hard acro=
ss sectarian lines to build diverse support for his government and for th=
e effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. And that's why the Unite=
d States has found Prime Minister Abadi and the Iraqi central government =
to be effective partners, and it's why we continue to stand with them as =
they confront this serious threat.=20



Jeff.



Q Thanks, Josh. The Brazilian senate is likely to suspend President Rouss=
eff today. What are the implications of that likely action for U.S.-Brazi=
l relations?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, you heard the President talk about this when he =
was in Argentina, and our view at this point has not changed. The Preside=
nt noted our confidence in the durability of Brazils democratic instituti=
ons to weather this political turmoil. Brazil has a system of laws, it's =
a mature democracy and it has an established system for resolving these p=
olitical conflicts inside their country.



So theres no denying that this is a challenging time for the nation of Br=
azil and for the government officials that are trying to lead that countr=
y. Obviously Brazil is under the international spotlight. The attention o=
f the world will be focused on Brazil later this summer when they host th=
e Olympic Games. So Brazil is under some scrutiny and under some pressure=
, and the United States is going to be there to support our friend and pa=
rtner as they deal with the significant challenges that theyre facing rig=
ht now.=20



But as it relates to the political situation, we continue to have confide=
nce in the mature, durable, democratic institutions in Brazil to withstan=
d the challenge.



Q Does that mean that the U.S. government does not have any concerns abou=
t how that process is playing out right now and whether it's legitimate a=
nd fair and following the laws that the Brazilian people have supported?



MR. EARNEST: Well, we obviously believe that these democratic institution=
s were established for a reason, and the rules that guide that democracy =
should be followed. I'm not going to render a judgment from here about in=
dividual claims or actions that have been taken by political leaders in B=
razil. Our hope -- and we continue to have confidence that those democrat=
ic institution in Brazil can weather the political turmoil that that coun=
try is dealing with right now.



Q And switching subjects to a domestic one. Theres a new poll, Reuters-Ip=
sos poll, out today which similar to some other ones that have come out r=
ecently, showing Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in a neck-for-neck race=
 in the general election. Is the fact that that general election is tight=
ening -- even though polls are very early and theres not a Democratic nom=
inee yet -- a concern to this White House, considering the fact that the =
President has said repeatedly hed like to see a Democrat succeed?



MR. EARNEST: Well, there are going to be a lot of polls that are conducte=
d between now and then, and that's an entirely legitimate endeavor. And s=
ometimes they can provide a valuable snapshot of the mood of the country =
and the preferences of the countrys voters.=20



The President has had ample opportunities already this year to talk about=
 how important this upcoming election is because of the -- in fact, that =
election is so important that the President expects, over the course of t=
he summer and certainly into the fall, to be dedicating a significant por=
tion of his time to engaging in the debate around the election. And the P=
resident does have a strong desire to be succeeded by someone who is comm=
itted to building on all of the important progress that we've made over t=
he last seven or eight years. And that I think will be the nature of the =
Presidents involvement and the argument that he hopes to make.



Q Are you concerned, though, about polls showing such a tight race right =
now between the Democrat and Donald Trump?



MR. EARNEST: I think what I would say is there are some polls that have b=
een released that show that the general election is not particularly clos=
e right now and there are others that have been released that indicate a =
closer race. The Presidents approach to this election will be the same re=
gardless of how close the polls indicate that the race is.=20



The stakes are too high to take this election lightly. Hosting a presiden=
tial election every four years means that the American people have an opp=
ortunity to weigh in on who is going to lead the country and who, in fact=
, is going to lead the free world. So the stakes of this election are hig=
h. The President believes that the outcome is critically important. And r=
egardless of what predictions are made about the outcome at this point, t=
he President will be fully engaged in making an argument about having a s=
uccessor that's committed to building on the progress that we've made ove=
r the last seven or eight years.

Q Thanks, Josh. Lawmakers in the House missed the self-imposed deadline t=
oday to release their Puerto Rico legislation. And I'm wondering how conc=
erned the White House is about this latest delay, whether you believe it'=
s just a temporary hiccup in getting legislation out.



MR. EARNEST: Well, what I do know is I do know that Democrats and Republi=
cans in the House continue to try to work through the differences that ha=
ve emerged as theyve tried to put this legislation together. We have work=
ed to try to nurture that bipartisan effort. There are experts in the U.S=
. government, particularly at the Treasury Department, that have offered =
technical assistance to those who are drafting the bills.=20



Our position on this has been clear from the beginning. It was back in Oc=
tober that we put forward our proposed legislative solution, and the view=
 of the administration is that Congress needs to provide Puerto Rico with=
 an orderly restructuring regime that would give the Puerto Rican governm=
ent the kind of authority that *states all across the country -- cities a=
nd states all across the country already have. And that restructuring aut=
hority would allow Puerto Rico to deal with the financial challenges that=
 theyre facing right now.



We also believe that in exchange for that authority, the Puerto Rican gov=
ernment should commit to implementing some economic and financial reforms=
 that would be good for the long-term health of the Puerto Rican economy.=
 And we believe that there should be some accountability associated with =
the implementation of those reforms. And there are a number of proposals =
for essentially independent oversight that could be provided to ensure th=
at Puerto Rico follows through on the reforms.



Theres some other proposals that we have looked favorably upon that would=
 do things like reform Puerto Ricos Medicaid program and extend the earne=
d income tax credit to taxpayers in Puerto Rico. This would have a positi=
ve economic benefit for Puerto Rico which would have a corresponding posi=
tive impact on the quality of life on the island and a positive impact on=
 the islands fiscal picture.=20



But right now, you have 3 million Americans -- more than 3 million Americ=
ans who are living on an island that is facing some austere challenges th=
at are already having a real-world impact on the lives of the Americans t=
here.=20



Secretary of Treasury Jack Lew visited Puerto Rico earlier this week and =
saw firsthand some of these challenges. I was actually in a meeting where=
 he was talking about this today. He talked about the fact that he visite=
d hospitals in Puerto Rico -- at least one hospital where doctors were ch=
allenged to acquire medicine that could be used to treat pediatric cancer=
 patients, and the challenge that they have is that they basically have t=
o pay for medicine COD. Theyve got to provide cash on delivery for that m=
edicine. So it's not a simple -- and they have to do that basically every=
 day. That means that a doctors ability to provide lifesaving medicine to=
 kids in Puerto Rico is affected by the weakening confidence in the Puert=
o Rican governments ability to pay their bills.



So there are human costs here. And these are American citizens that we're=
 talking about. So it's easy to get lost in an esoteric debate about whic=
h bond holder is going to get paid first and how much theyre going to get=
 paid. But the truth is, resolving these challenges and resolving them so=
on is going to have an impact on the lives of innocent Americans in Puert=
o Rico.



Q But just to be clear, the latest delay that crept up today, does the Wh=
ite House view that more as, I guess, procedural snafu, like how you term=
ed it during our conversations about TPA, or is this a broader conflict t=
hat you're concerned that is not going to be able to be resolved?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I'd go back to where I started, which is that =
there are still Democrats and Republicans on the committee in the House t=
hat are working in good faith to try to produce a piece of bipartisan leg=
islation that would address the concerns that I laid out. So we've got co=
nfidence in that process. We're going to continue to support and try to n=
urture that process to yield a piece of legislation that would address th=
e many challenges facing Puerto Rico.=20



And we're hopeful -- look, theres no denying that Congress is late to the=
 game here, and there has been some -- theres has been an unhelpful effor=
t on the part of some Republicans to gum up the works here, including by =
lobbing false charges, suggesting that somehow this is a bailout of Puert=
o Rico. It's not. And the irony is, is that the more success that those R=
epublicans have in gumming up the works the more likely it is that the on=
ly alternative for dealing with Puerto Rico will be a bailout. And that's=
 something that we all want to avoid. And that's why we have been urging =
Congress to act in bipartisan fashion to pass this bill.=20



 Suzanne.



 Q If I could follow up with Puerto Rico. Does the administration have a =
forecast if it doesnt meet its July deadline in making the $2 billion pay=
ment?



 MR. EARNEST: I'm sure that there have been a number of forecasts that ha=
ve been conducted. I haven't seen one that we've made public. But you can=
 check with the Treasury Department about that.



 Q Can you talk more broadly about the situation in Puerto Rico in terms =
of how it's impacting education, health care, and also fighting the Zika =
virus? I understand there have been more than 600 cases there already.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'd refer you to the Treasury Department again=
 because Secretary Lew was just there on Monday and he saw a bunch of the=
se negative impacts firsthand. And I just relayed the example of him visi=
ting a hospital there. That obviously is a pretty graphic illustration of=
 the challenges that Puerto Rico is facing as a result of these budgetary=
 problems. And I think they are a good illustration of why Congress needs=
 to act as soon as possible so that we can get to work fixing these probl=
ems.=20



 I haven't seen the latest tally in terms of the number of Zika cases tha=
t have been identified in Puerto Rico. But obviously Puerto Rico is under=
 great financial strain. Obviously that financial strain is having an imp=
act on their ability to invest in their public health system. And given t=
he threat that Zika poses to pregnant women and their babies, now seems l=
ike a bad time for investments in public health to be undermined. In fact=
, this is actually a time when we should be redoubling our efforts to mak=
e sure that we can address cases of the Zika virus quickly and try to pre=
vent it from spreading.



 Q Have you seen any impact in New York or Florida regarding the financia=
l hardship of Puerto Rico?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I mean, I think what we have seen is we certainly hav=
e seen an increase in the number of people who are leaving Puerto Rico. I=
 think that is a testament to the difficult economic challenges that are =
facing the island, and those are not at all unrelated to the budgetary ch=
allenges that are facing the government.=20



 So I can't speak to any of the specific, tangible impact that we've seen=
 in any of those two states, but obviously there are a host of concerns t=
hat have been raised and that have been exacerbated by Congresss failure =
to act promptly here. So we know what needs to be done. The administratio=
n put forward a proposal back in October, laying out exactly how we could=
 address these challenges.=20



So, fortunately, there does seem to be a tenacious bipartisan effort unde=
rway to try to resolve those differences. I say tenacious because we've b=
een talking about this for a long time, but we haven't actually seen any =
action, but hopefully Democrats and Republicans will both continue to sta=
y engaged in this effort because theres a real human toll here that's alr=
eady being taken as a result of these financial challenges.



Q Hi, Josh. The President has refrained from weighing in the Democratic p=
rimary, but the Vice President hasnt done the same. This morning he told =
Good Morning America that he thought Hillary Clinton would become the nom=
inee and would go on to win the presidency. Did he consult with the White=
 House before making his public preferences known?=20



MR. EARNEST: Well, I think -- again, I had a chance to take a look at the=
 transcript. Youd have to ask the Vice Presidents office -- I don't think=
 that he was doing much more than just making an observation about the ma=
th of the race, particularly as it relates to the delegate count. Youd ha=
ve to ask his office if he intended that as him putting forward his own e=
ndorsement in the race.



Q Does the White House feel like it is an appropriate time to now make en=
dorsements with the delegate map being what it is?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have anything to say about President Obamas pl=
ans to weigh in on the race at this point.



Q Okay. And on Zika, obviously the White House is concerned that Congress=
 isn't doing enough to protect Americans. Is there a concern that Brazil =
isnt doing enough to protect Americans that may be going to the Olympics,=
 with the continuing problems that we're already starting to discuss in B=
razil?



MR. EARNEST: Well, we know that the Zika virus is much more widespread in=
 Brazil than it is in the United States. And we have offered our assistan=
ce and support to Brazilian authorities as they try to contain this threa=
t. And they obviously are working very hard to ensure that all of the wor=
ld-class athletes that will be descending upon Brazil can do so safely. A=
nd we obviously would be supportive of any effort that they would underta=
ke to ensure the safety of those who are participating in the games.



Q Has the President or any member of the First Family decided if theyd be=
 attending the games?



MR. EARNEST: At this point, we haven't made a decision about the Presiden=
ts summer travel yet.=20



Q Okay. One last thing on Zika. Senator Flake was saying that $35 million=
 in taxpayer-funded studies could have been better spent on things like Z=
ika. He points to drunk birds slurring when they sing, some people seeing=
 Jesuss face on toast, and honeybees on cocaine. Does the White House hav=
e any comments in response to Senator Flake?



MR. EARNEST: Yes, I think it's pretty pathetic when we're facing a signif=
icant public health crisis, as described by our public health experts, th=
at you would see someone try to distract from what is a pretty important =
issue. Ive had an opportunity to meet Senator Flake on a couple of occasi=
ons. Hes an honorable guy and he certainly is the kind of person that we =
would rely on to show some bipartisan leadership, respond to the requests=
 of Democratic and Republican governors, respond to the request of public=
 health professionals, and advance the $1.9 billion in funding that is ne=
eded to confront the Zika virus and do everything we possibly can to prot=
ect the American people. So I'll leave it at that.



April.



Q Josh, a couple different subjects. First, I want to stay with Zika. The=
 World Health Organization says it's just as important as Ebola. What doe=
s this White House feel about that? They are calling it a possible pandem=
ic.



MR. EARNEST: Well, we've gone to great lengths to help people understand =
the difference between the Zika virus and the Ebola virus. Obviously the =
--



Q The level of concern is such that it's like Ebola. That's what theyre s=
aying.



MR. EARNEST: Well, again, the viruses are different; the impact that they=
 have on people are different. But given the significant risk that we kno=
w the Zika virus poses to pregnant women and their babies, we believe tha=
t urgent action is necessary to do everything we can to try to protect th=
e American people, especially pregnant women and their babies.=20



So theres no reason this has to be a partisan exercise. This should be a =
common-sense responsibility that Republicans in Congress should embrace. =
They ran for Congress so that they could help run the country. Running th=
e country means your top priority should be protecting the American peopl=
e. This is something that Congress can and should do to protect the Ameri=
can people. Theyre about three months late in doing it, but they need to =
put a bill on the Presidents desk before they leave for yet another reces=
s on Memorial Day.



Q And the next question on Zika -- where does this administration weigh i=
n on the issues being discussed between health officials about the fact t=
hat Zika is such a threat that people, families, may want to delay pregna=
ncies? Where does the White House weigh in on that?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I think we would weigh in on this by saying that peopl=
e should consult their doctors and that the kinds of decisions that famil=
ies are making about either starting or growing their family are decision=
s that they should make within their family and with the best medical adv=
ice that they can get from their doctors.=20



Obviously the CDC and the NIH have shared medical information about the r=
isks posed by Zika to pregnant women with doctors all across the country.=
 We have tried to do as much as we possibly can to educate people about w=
hat exactly those risks are. And I certainly would encourage people who a=
re thinking about becoming pregnant to consult the CDC website, to consul=
t their doctor, and understand exactly what the risks are as they make th=
at decision.



Q So listening to the doctors debate back and forth about it -- does the =
White House view it as an ethical issue not to weigh into that debate? Be=
cause you're telling people what to do -- women or husbands, wives, or wh=
omever -- about planning a family -- as this is as serious -- as you're s=
aying, possible birth defects for those who are pregnant, for their child=
ren.



MR. EARNEST: Well, I think our desire is for people to have access to the=
 best medical information possible as they make these intensely personal =
decisions. Obviously the government is not going to be making decisions f=
or people, particularly when it comes to something as personal as startin=
g or growing your family. But we do want people to have access to the bes=
t information they can get as they make that important and very personal =
decision.



Q And on two other subjects. Any word from the President, particularly as=
 he drank the water three times in Flint -- does he have any comment abou=
t this lawsuit, about the mayor diverting funds in Flint?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any comment to share from the President a=
bout ongoing litigation. The President did have an opportunity when he wa=
s in Flint to see firsthand the impact this crisis has had on that commun=
ity. The President has made clear hes going to mobilize resources from fe=
deral government to help that local community. And that's why youve seen =
millions of dollars in public health grants go to Flint to help doctors a=
nd nurses and other public health workers there deal with the medical fal=
lout of that crisis situation. The President has urged Congress to act on=
 funding so that the state of Michigan and the city of Flint can make the=
 necessary infrastructure investments to protect the people in that commu=
nity.=20



But, look, the city of Flint and the people who live there are enduring a=
 significant challenge, and the Presidents visit there last week was an i=
mportant sign to them that the U.S. President has the back of the people =
in that community that are working hard to rebuild that community and ens=
ure that their children can dream as big as ever.



Q And last question -- West Point cadets were clear. Did the President se=
e the picture? Did he weigh in? Did you talk to him about it?=20



 MR. EARNEST: I havent spoken to him about the picture, but I did see the=
 news reports about the decision that was made by officials at West Point=
.



 Q So speaking for the White House -- =20



 MR. EARNEST: I'm confident that the President would not second-guess a d=
ecision that was made by those who are responsible for discipline at West=
 Point.



 Margaret.



 Q Josh, given what a deadly it was in Baghdad, are there any plans for t=
he President or perhaps the Vice President to reach out to the Abadi lead=
ership?

=20

 MR. EARNEST: I dont have any calls to announce at this point. But, typic=
ally, when either the President or the Vice President is in touch with Pr=
ime Minister Abadi, we read out the call after it's taken place, and I'm =
sure we'll do that in this case, as well.



 Q Given not just today's violence, but the political crisis that's ongoi=
ng in Baghdad, I mean, does the White House still believe that Abadi is s=
trong, as the Secretary of Defense described him just a week ago?



 MR. EARNEST: The administration is still committed -- the U.S. governmen=
t is still committed to supporting Prime Minister Abadi's efforts to refo=
rm the political system and to govern that country in an inclusive way. T=
hat's going to be critical to the ability of Iraq to secure their country=
 and to face down the threat that is posed by ISIL. That is the approach =
that Prime Minister Abadi has pursued, even under unquestionably challeng=
ing circumstances. And the United States will continue to strongly suppor=
t Prime Minister Abadi and the Iraqi people as they work to unite their c=
ountry to face down that threat from ISIL.



 Q But do you believe a political crisis -- I'm sorry, does the White Hou=
se believe that a political crisis is adding to this insecurity that we'r=
e seeing on the streets of Baghdad?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, there's no denying that what we see is a chaotic situ=
ation in Iraq. I suspect that the direction of influence, though, is a li=
ttle more along the lines of what Brad laid out, which is that the instab=
ility around the security situation in Iraq is making governing that coun=
try more challenging. And those are the challenging circumstances I was r=
eferring to in terms of Prime Minister Abadi's tenure as Prime Minister. =
So that certainly is why the United States has been so invested -- along =
with our coalition partners -- in trying to stabilize the -- trying to he=
lp the Iraqi government and the Iraqi security forces stabilize the situa=
tion inside of Iraq.=20



There's a lot of important progress that we've made over the last almost =
two years now in driving ISIL out of significant populated areas that the=
y used to control, but there obviously is a lot more work to be done. And=
 there was a reference earlier to the effort to drive ISIL out of Mosul, =
and that will be a tall order. But the United States and our coalition pa=
rtners have worked effectively with Iraqi security forces to begin the ef=
fort to shape that military strategy. And we're going to continue to supp=
ort Prime Minister Abadi as he pursues a governing agenda that reflects t=
he diversity of the nation of Iraq.



 Q I imagine some of this came out during the NSC meeting yesterday. The =
government spokesperson in Baghdad today said that just 14 percent of ter=
ritory in Iraq is still under the control of ISIS. Do those numbers sound=
 right to you?



 MR. EARNEST: I havent seen that specific statistic. I would encourage yo=
u to check with the Department of Defense to try to confirm it. The stati=
stic that we've used comes at it from a different perspective. What we ha=
ve said is that our coalition, working closely with Iraqi security forces=
, has driven ISIL out of about 40 percent of the populated territory that=
 ISIL previously controlled.=20



What that says in terms of the overall percentage of the country, I haven=
t seen a statistic along those lines, so I'd encourage you to check with =
either the State Department or the Department of the Defense to try to co=
nfirm that specific statement. But I think the statistic that we have con=
firmed I think does illustrate the important progress against ISIL that's=
 been made. That progress was only possible because of the willingness an=
d courage of Iraqi forces that were willing to fight for their country.=20=




And the weakness that we saw in the Iraqi security forces, back in the su=
mmer of 2014, was a symptom of a lack of a willingness to fight for the e=
ntire country. There is a part of those Iraqi forces that, based on secta=
rian considerations, left them less willing to defend certain parts of th=
eir country. And working to pursue a governing agenda, working to diversi=
fy Iraq's security forces and to bring them under the command and control=
 of the Iraqi central government -- all those are positive steps and all =
of those have contributed to the progress that we've against ISIL thus fa=
r. And it's a testament to Prime Minister Abadi's leadership that he was =
able to do that -- again, under some very difficult and challenging circu=
mstances.



 But, look, it's also understandable that there would be some impatience =
on the part of the Iraqi people and other figures in the Iraqi government=
 about the security situation there. But Prime Minister Abadi has clearly=
 made this a priority. And the American government and the United States =
military and the 65 nations who are part of our coalition have been stron=
gly supportive of Prime Minister Abadi's efforts and pleased with the imp=
ortant progress that's been made over the last year and a half or so.=20



 Q Quickly, on Syrian refugees. Does the President get updates on the num=
bers of refugees that are being processed into the U.S.? And do you still=
 believe that 10,000 is roughly the number that are going to be taken in =
this year?



 MR. EARNEST: The President does receive periodic updates about the progr=
ess that's being made to accomplish the goal that he laid out, I believe =
at the end of last year, to take in 10,000 Syrian refugees during this fi=
scal year. There are reports indicating that we've got some work to do to=
 meet that goal. The President has made clear, both publicly and privatel=
y, that this is a priority. And the national security officials that are =
responsible for implementing this progress understand exactly what the Co=
mmander-in-Chief's priorities are.=20



 The President acknowledged at the beginning that this would be a challen=
ging goal to meet, in part because individuals who enter the United State=
s through the refugee program are subjected to more background checks and=
 screening than anybody else who enters the United States. And the Presid=
ent was clear that we would meet this goal without cutting any corners wh=
en it comes to security. So I think that sort of describes the nature of =
the challenge facing those who are implementing this program. But the Pre=
sident is serious about meeting this goal, and there's a lot of work to d=
o to make that a reality.=20



 Kevin.

=20

 Q Thanks, Josh. Interesting piece by David Ignatius in the Post, quoting=
 Director Clapper, who said, among other things, about the battle to reta=
ke Mosul -- you admitted it's a tall order -- he said he didnt think it c=
ould be accomplished within the time frame under this administration. How=
 much of a surprise is that to you? And is that something that the Presid=
ent anticipated?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, when the President has talked about this, the Preside=
nt has been focused on the kind of shaping operations that I described ea=
rlier. And the goal that we've laid out is to try and put in place the co=
nditions by the end of the year where Mosul could be retaken. So that is =
the goal that we're aiming for. Obviously, all of this work is being led =
by the Iraqi central government and the Iraqi security forces, but the Un=
ited States and the rest of the international community has bought in on =
this strategy, and the groundwork is being laid even as we speak. But thi=
s is a tall order. This is the second-largest city in Iraq. So this is go=
ing to be a big challenge, but it obviously would be, and will be, a sign=
ificant strategic accomplishment once that city has been retaken.



 Q He went on to say that he didnt think that the U.S. could fix it -- ta=
lking about the grander problems that are prevalent not just on the groun=
d, but systematic problems that are there. What does the President think =
of that perspective?



 MR. EARNEST: The President agrees wholeheartedly. This is a problem that=
 the Iraqi people are going to have to solve when it comes to addressing =
the challenges in their own country. We've tried the path of the United S=
tates trying to impose a solution on these countries that are facing so m=
uch turmoil and violence, and that didnt work out very well. It didnt wor=
k out very well for the United States; it didnt work out very well for th=
e Iraqi people, either. So we need to pursue a strategy where we are empo=
wering the Iraqi government, the Iraqi security forces, and the Iraqi peo=
ple to confront successfully the problems that are plaguing their own nat=
ion.



 Q And the President then, you would say, also agrees with his assessment=
 that we should be there because leaving would create a problem as well?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the President believes that, at this point in time, w=
e should be actively supporting the efforts of Prime Minister Abadi to un=
ite his country to face down the threat from ISIL. We cannot afford to ta=
ke the risk of allowing ISIL to fill a security vacuum. We know that that=
 would have a direct and negative impact on the United States' national s=
ecurity.=20



So we take this quite seriously, and I think it would explain why the Pre=
sident has ordered more than 12,000 airstrikes against ISIL targets in Ir=
aq and in Syria. It's why the President has given his military orders to =
implement a strategy to build up the capacity of Iraqi security forces to=
 degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. It's also why we've pursued the oth=
er elements of our strategy to shut down ISIL's financing and stop the fl=
ow of foreign fighters, all in an effort to degrade and ultimately destro=
y ISIL, because we know that the consequences of allowing ISIL to establi=
sh a safe haven inside of Iraq would be dire, both for the United States =
but for our partners and allies around the world.



 Q And based on that, should the American people receive that as a messag=
e that it's going as expected?



 MR. EARNEST: I think the American people can be confident that the Comma=
nder-in-Chief understands what's necessary to protect the American people=
. They can also be confident that President Obama understands that gettin=
g the United States directly involved on the frontlines of a ground war i=
n the Middle East where the United States has committed tens of thousands=
 of ground troops in a combat operation would be a bad idea and contrary =
to our interests. This President --



 Q I wasnt clear. I meant based on what you were saying -- some of the th=
ings you just pointed had successes. Should the American people then take=
 from that the President feels like it's going as it should be?



 MR. EARNEST: I think people can be confident that the President recogniz=
es the stakes; that people can be confident that the President believes t=
hat we've made important progress, but I think we can also be confident, =
and the American people can be confident, that what the President expects=
 to do is to continue this progress through the eight months that are rem=
aining, and present the next President with a path toward accomplishing t=
his broader goal.=20



But it's going to require the United States to continue to support the Ab=
adi-led government that's committed to an inclusive agenda, and it's also=
 going to require continuing to engage the rest of the international comm=
unity in this effort. This is not something that the United States can or=
 will do alone, but we will play a leading role in leading an internation=
al coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. And under President =
Obama's leadership, that's exactly what we've done.



 Q Last one. Would the President consider backing an idea of partitioning=
 the country?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, there are obviously people that have floated this ide=
a in a variety of contexts, including even the Vice President in his pres=
idential campaign eight years ago. What our policy and our belief continu=
es to be is that Iraq will be most successful in their fight against ISIL=
 if they can succeed in uniting that country to face down the security th=
reat that ISIL poses.=20



 We believe that Iraq is stronger when it's united. And I think the best =
evidence that we have of this is that President Abadi's predecessor, Prim=
e Minister Maliki, did pursue a rather sectarian governing agenda, and th=
e vulnerabilities in that agenda were laid bare when you saw Iraqi securi=
ty forces that were charged with protecting that country essentially melt=
 away when ISIL began their initial assault on their country.



 So that's why the President essentially made a precondition of robust U.=
S. military involvement in the counter-ISIL effort in Iraq that the Iraqi=
 people elect and support a Prime Minister who's committed to reforming t=
he government in pursuing the kind of inclusive governing agenda that wou=
ld unite the country to face the threat. That's exactly what Prime Minist=
er Abadi has done. That's why the U.S. government has been supportive of =
his efforts to do so. And that's why we continue to stand with the Iraqi =
people in this very difficult time.

 Q A couple of quick ones. Zika -- there was money taken from the emergen=
cy fund, right -- the Ebola fund? What is the status of that? And is it y=
our position that that money is going to run out soon and that there is n=
o other opportunity to tap into that same fund if Congress doesnt come up=
 with something?



 MR. EARNEST: Our posture on this has been that using that money was esse=
ntially a last resort to try and do as much as we possibly can to protect=
 the American people from the Zika virus. But what our public health prof=
essionals have said, what Dr. Fauci said when he was standing at this pod=
ium about a month or so ago is that that money, about $600 million, was i=
nsufficient to fund all of the things that the federal government can and=
 should be doing to try to prepare for the onset of the Zika virus.



 Q So there's no more money in that fund? There's no more money available=
 from that emergency fund to the administration?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, we can check with OMB on this. I think what it actual=
ly is, is that we have basically taken as much money as we can from those=
 accounts without undermining the important public health work that they'=
re already doing. We didnt want to be in a situation where we were essent=
ially eliminating all of the funding to fight Ebola to try to come back a=
nd fight Zika, because that would be a pretty unwise decision, as well.=20=




So what we've done is basically taken as much money as we possibly can wi=
thout totally gutting the Ebola program to direct it towards Zika. Now, t=
o succeed against Ebola, we're going to need that money to be repaid, and=
 to be repaid quickly. So we need Congress to act on that, as well. I don=
t want them to think that this is money that was just sitting around with=
 nothing to do. The fact is, this is money that was available that we cou=
ld use toward Zika without undermining the Ebola effort, but we need the =
Ebola effort to be fully funded, as well. And I think everybody who cover=
ed this White House in the fall of 2014 would acknowledge that we're not =
going to take Ebola lightly and that that would be a bad decision for the=
 country.



Q In Iraq, following the breach of the Green Zone, is the -- what has bee=
n done by the United States to make sure that -- and are you confident th=
at that will not happen again? There were reports that Iraqi security for=
ces basically let these protesters in. There was some concern about the A=
merican embassy and that -- theres been more Marines sent in. What is the=
 administrations level of concern about that embassy, and who is responsi=
ble for that?



MR. EARNEST: Well, obviously the nation of Iraq has obligations to protec=
t all of the diplomatic facilities on their soil, and weve received assur=
ances from the Iraqi government that they understand that thats their obl=
igation.



 In addition to that, the State Department has ordered some steps to ensu=
re that the embassy -- the U.S. embassy in Baghdad is secure. I think for=
 obvious reasons I wont be able to detail all of the security precautions=
 that have been taken, but the safety and security of our diplomats servi=
ng the United States around the world is the Presidents top priority. And=
 he has made clear to his team that all the necessary steps that need to =
be taken to ensure their safety at the embassy in Baghdad are taken. And =
Im confident that the State Department has done that.



 Q And given the continued violence there, and the concern obviously abou=
t embassies everywhere in light of the Benghazi situation and because tha=
ts become such a political issue, the administration is confident that th=
at embassy -- that leaving the primary responsibility to the Iraqis is su=
fficient?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, every nation has an obligation to safeguard the diplo=
matic facilities that are on their countrys soil. The United States, for =
example, has an obligation to ensure the safety and security of foreign d=
iplomats that are serving here in the United States. We take that obligat=
ion seriously, and we obviously expect that other countries around the wo=
rld take that obligation seriously.



 But, of course, at U.S. diplomatic facilities all around the world there=
 are United States Marine Corps servicemembers who are standing guard. An=
d the President takes that security quite seriously, but that certainly d=
oes not absolve local governments of the responsibility that they have to=
 ensure the safety and security of our diplomats as well.



 Q One more. On this issue of the President and the press thats been out =
there lately -- I sent you this this earlier -- the American Presidency P=
roject in Santa Barbara -- UC Santa Barbara -- did an analysis that shows=
 that President Obama has had fewer press conferences -- is on pace to ha=
ve fewer press conferences than his previous two predecessors. And the mo=
nthly and average rate that hes been doing these at is less than his thre=
e previous predecessors. Is that correct?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are a lot of different ways to slice an=
d dice these numbers. Obviously the President was just out here five days=
 ago doing a news conference with all of you, standing at this podium. So=
 he does them with some regularity. But there are a lot of different ways=
 to slice and dice the numbers here.=20



 Q But they counted press conferences -- formal press conferences, briefi=
ng room appearances, joint press conferences with other world leaders. I =
believe its a fairly credible institution. But the point is that, by a co=
uple of different measurements, the President has been much less accessib=
le -- less accessible -- I dont want to put an adjective in there -- to t=
he press than his previous predecessors. And, of course, there is still t=
ime to go. But you dont see it that way or he doesnt see it that way?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President has done a lot of news conferen=
ces. It certainly is your job as you sit here in the briefing room and as=
 you cover the President every day to advocate for more access to the Pre=
sident and for more news conferences and more opportunities to ask him qu=
estions. We certainly understand thats a part of your job and thats part =
of the give and take that has characterized the relationship between the =
White House and White House press corps for at least one century, probabl=
y two.



 I think what is also true is that this President has done more one-on-on=
e interviews with reporters, both from the White House and from other pla=
ces, than any of his predecessors. I think that is a testament to the Pre=
sidents desire to try to engage with independent professional journalists=
 who are interested in understanding exactly what hes doing.=20



 But, look, I dont take any exception to your advocacy for more access to=
 the President. That certainly is part of your job description.



 Mark.



 Q Josh, is there any White House response to the growing complaints abou=
t the TSA and the long lines at airport security checkpoints lately, with=
 the summer travel season nearing?



 Mr. EARNEST: Im not aware of any specific White House order thats been i=
ssued on this. I do know that the TSA certainly takes very seriously the =
responsibility that they have to protect our aviation system, but also to=
 minimize the inconvenience to U.S. travelers.=20



 So theyre mindful of the responsibility that they have. Certainly some o=
f the challenges that theyre facing right now could be alleviated if they=
 got all of the funding that we would like to see them have. So once agai=
n, a problem that people have noticed can be traced back pretty directly =
to the inability of Republicans in Congress to govern the country. But wh=
at I also know that the TSA has done is theyve brought on some additional=
 staff, including those with some management expertise, to try to address=
 some of these problems, given the resource constraints that theyre opera=
ting under.



 Q I also wanted to ask about the national mammal bill that the President=
 signed on Monday. Were there any White House deliberations on honoring t=
he North American bison among all other mammals, including people, I gues=
s? (Laughter.)



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Mark, I can tell you -- thats an interesting question=
. Well, I can tell you that there was a robust legislative effort on the =
part of the White House on this one. We were determined not to get buffal=
oed on this. (Laughter.)



 Q I did not set him up. (Laughter.)



 MR. EARNEST: But obviously, this is a piece of legislation thats passed =
through the Congress and I would anticipate that the President will sign =
it.



 Q I also wondered if you saw that New York Times story yesterday about M=
rs. Clinton promising to get to the bottom of the UFO and Area 51 conspir=
acies. And I wondered if the President would like to beat her to the punc=
h by showing his degree of transparency on this issue, which is of concer=
n to a lot of Americans.



 MR. EARNEST: I have to admit, I dont have a tab in my briefing book for =
Area 51 today.=20



 Q Or a joke.



 MR. EARNEST: Or a joke.



 Q Because its (inaudible).=20



 MR. EARNEST: Maybe it has -- part of a grand conspiracy. Im not aware of=
 any plans that the President has to make public any information about th=
is.



 Q Does he feel hes gotten to the bottom of it?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I know that he has joked publicly before about one of=
 the benefits of the presidency is having access to that information. I d=
ont know whether or not he has availed himself of that opportunity. But i=
f we have more on this, well let you know.=20



 Q At night, under the cover of darkness? (Laughter.)



 MR. EARNEST: Potentially.=20



 Scott.



 Q Is the Presidents meeting with the Secretary of Treasury this afternoo=
n mostly about Puerto Rico, or could you give us a little insight on what=
 theyre talking about?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, this is just part of the regular -- I believe its a b=
i-weekly meeting that the President has with the Secretary of the Treasur=
y. I would anticipate that high on the agenda will be getting a readout f=
rom Secretary Lew about his trip to Puerto Rico. And I just described to =
you some of what Secretary Lew saw firsthand when he visited Puerto Rico,=
 and I would anticipate that hell talk with the President about that a li=
ttle bit more as well.=20



 I would also anticipate that other budgetary issues will be on the agend=
a as well. But once that meeting concludes, well see if we can get you so=
me more details about what they discussed.

 Q Thanks, Josh. Following up on the line of questioning about Brazil, th=
eres a very real possibility that there could for some time be two Brazil=
ian Presidents concurrently, one interim President and one suspended Pres=
ident. How would the administration handle relations with Brazil if that =
does come to pass?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, we obviously would follow the traditions and the laws=
 of Brazil. And, again, what I understand about this process comes entire=
ly from reading news accounts of whats happening there -- or almost entir=
ely of news accounts from whats happening there. And the way that I under=
stand how this process works is that if the vote in the Senate goes the w=
ay that many people are predicting, then President Rousseff would step as=
ide while the charges against her are heard by the appropriate legislativ=
e body. And the current Vice President would assume the constitutional po=
wers of the presidency until such time as the allegations against Preside=
nt Rousseff are resolved. Thats my understanding about the way the proces=
s works, and the U.S. government and our diplomats who are serving in Bra=
zil would engage with the Brazilian government according to their rules a=
nd traditions.



 Q And does this situation provide an opening, potentially, for an improv=
ement of relations with Brazil? Theyve been an important partner of the U=
.S., but the government has been in power for over a decade -- the party =
has been in power that was aligned with the U.S. interests. Is there a si=
lver lining here for the U.S. in the disarray of the Brazilian government=
?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, listen, President Rousseff was here at the White Hous=
e a little over a year ago, and I think that a hallmark of that visit was=
 effective coordination between the United States and Brazil on a whole r=
ange of issues -- everything from the economy to national security to eve=
n climate change. So weve been able to do a lot of important work with th=
e Brazilian government, and wed certainly look for any additional opportu=
nities that are available to cooperate with them even further to make pro=
gress on priorities that President Obama has identified.



 Gardiner.



 Q Does the President support Paul Ryans plan to confront the opioid cris=
is? He recently came out with a plan.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I have heard some discussion about their plan. I thin=
k its a series of bills that they have -- I believe its 18 different bill=
s that theyre considering, none of which actually include any funding, wh=
ich is unfortunate and it raises questions about what exactly they hope t=
he impact of these bills would be. I know that there has been some concer=
n expressed by the Speakers office that the political turmoil inside the =
Republican Party is overshadowing this particular legislative effort. I t=
hink my observation would be, if there were actually some substance behin=
d this legislative effort, it might get some more deserved attention. If =
there were actual funding in here to support more access to treatment and=
 more evidence-based treatment options for people across the country, I s=
uspect it would be worthy of more public attention.=20



 But, unfortunately, thats not the option that Republicans have chosen. I=
t is particularly unfortunate because the President put forward his own p=
roposal, totaling about a billion dollars that would make important inves=
tments in research and treatment and recovery programs. But as youll reca=
ll, Gardiner, Republicans for the first time in four decades declined to =
even hear from the Presidents Budget Director about that priority.=20



 So Republicans paying lip service to an issue that they know is importan=
t to voters, without actually doing something substantive to address it, =
and, in fact, actively blocking Obama administration efforts to address i=
t is kind of an old story, but its the reputation that Republicans have e=
mbraced for seven years now and its a reputation that they demonstrate is=
 well-earned.



 Q Back to the refugee numbers. The President is hosting a refugee summit=
 in September. It looks like, as you have somewhat admitted, youre going =
to be way behind on admitting even the small number of Syrian refugees th=
at the President has vowed to admit. How is the administration, how is th=
e President going to speak with these world leaders and urge them to do m=
ore when the United States seems to not only have such a paltry goal on S=
yrian refugees to begin with but is probably not even going to be close t=
o meeting even that small goal at that point?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Gardiner, there are several more months left in the f=
iscal year. And at this point in time in the last fiscal year, there was =
skepticism about whether or not the administration would succeed in meeti=
ng the goal for admitting refugees that we had set for last year. And in =
the last few months of the fiscal year, the pace ramped up and that goal =
was met.



 This administration is focused on doing that again, but we will not do t=
hat in a way that results in a weakening of security standards. This is a=
 challenging task. Individuals who enter the United States through the re=
fugee program are subjected to more scrutiny, more vetting, and more back=
ground checks than anybody else who enters the United States. And the Pre=
sident is determined to keep those strict security measures in place, eve=
n as we ramp up the number of people who are admitted to the United State=
s. That imposes a significant strain on our system, but the President is =
determined to meet that goal. He has made that clear to his team, and tha=
ts something that were going to continue to strive for.



 I think when you step back and look at the longer-term picture in terms =
of the United States record on the U.N. refugee program, its hard for oth=
er countries to criticize, particularly when you consider that over the l=
ast several years the United States has taken in more people through the =
U.N. refugee program than every other nation in the world -- than all the=
 other nations in the world combined.



 But given the significant crisis in Syria, its clear that those efforts =
need to be expanded not just here in the United States but in other count=
ries around the world. And thats what the goal of the U.N. meeting will b=
e, will be to encourage nations around the world to raise their ambitions=
 when it comes to meeting the basic humanitarian needs of people who are =
fleeing their homes to escape violence.=20



 Lauren.



 Q On Capitol Hill today there is a meeting -- a hearing about Boko Haram=
, and one of the people who are testifying is a schoolgirl who was abduct=
ed. What the lawmakers are saying is that Boko Haram is the most dangerou=
s terrorist organization. Does the White House agree with that, or does t=
hat honor go to al Qaeda and ISIS?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, the President understands how dangerous Bo=
ko Haram is. That is why we have devoted significant resources to assisti=
ng the Nigerian government and building up their capacity to confront Bok=
o Haram in their country. Were mindful of that threat, and we understand =
the terrible violence that they have perpetrated against innocent people =
not just in Nigeria but across that region.



 So the United States continues to stand with the Nigerian government and=
 the Nigerian people as they face down this threat. And were mindful of t=
he need to continue to apply pressure to those extremist organizations, a=
nd arent able to establish the kind of foothold that would allow them to =
significantly expand the territory and people that are affected by their =
violent acts.



 Q Are they worse?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, its hard to say. But obviously we take the thr=
eat that they pose quite seriously. This is a terrible, violent extremist=
 organization, and weve worked hard to support the Nigerian government as=
 theyve gone after them.



 Q There were three suicide bombings in Baghdad today, targeting Shiite M=
uslims. Is it the U.S.s responsibility to promote religious liberty in th=
at region?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the values of the United States are values that were =
interested in promoting everywhere, and obviously there are different cul=
tures, different security climates, but we certainly -- the President tak=
es seriously the responsibility that our government has to promote our va=
lues around the world. And I think that even a casual observer of this si=
tuation would acknowledge that just a little bit of religious tolerance i=
n this part of the world would go a long way to addressing the kind of ch=
aos and violence that has stemmed from many of the sectarian atrocities t=
hat have been committed.



 Atsushi.



 Q Thanks, Josh. A couple of things about the Presidents upcoming trip to=
 Vietnam and Japan. Firstly, on Japan, I understand the President will pr=
ovide a forward-looking vision when he visits Hiroshima. Will the Preside=
nt also mention not only about Hiroshima but Nagasaki during the speech o=
r deliver that message?



 MR. EARNEST: I dont have much of a preview of those comments to share wi=
th you at this point. I know that in some places, the Presidents visit to=
 Hiroshima was covered as the President planning to give a major speech i=
n Hiroshima. Thats not accurate. When he visits Hiroshima, I would antici=
pate the President will have an opportunity to reflect on his time there,=
 but the President does not plan to deliver a major address in Hiroshima.=
 But I dont have any more details about those remarks to share at this po=
int, but as it gets closer, well keep you posted.



 Q How is the President going to deliver the message? In front of the aud=
ience or just in front of the media outlets?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, our advance team is preparing to arrive in Japan in j=
ust a couple of days, so were still working through the logistics and wel=
l keep you posted.



 Q Does the President have a plan to visit the Peace Memorial Museum in H=
iroshima?



 MR. EARNEST: Again, were still working through the logistics of the Pres=
idents visit, but well keep you posted. These are all good questions. As =
we get farther down the line of planning the Presidents visit, well be ab=
le to give you more detail about what the President will see.



 Q On Vietnam, President Obama will visit Vietnam for the first time and =
the second visit of a sitting President, I believe. Is there any signific=
ant meaning in terms of reconciliation between the two countries, the Uni=
ted States and Vietnam? In Ho Chi Minh City, whats the plan? What is the =
plan for the President to visit, or what kind of message is the President=
 going to deliver in Saigon?



 MR. EARNEST: The President will spend a couple of days in Vietnam. It is=
 his first trip to Vietnam as President of the United States, and the Pre=
sident will spend time with the kind of bilateral program that youve come=
 to expect when you see the President travel overseas. Hell meet with hig=
h-ranking government officials and spend time talking about the importanc=
e of our bilateral relationship. And Im confident that will touch on aspe=
cts of our security relationship but also aspects of our economic relatio=
nship as well.=20



 Vietnam has been a part of the TPP negotiations, and the prospect of Vie=
tnam taking steps to raise labor, human rights, and environmental standar=
ds, and give U.S. businesses more access to a rapidly growing Vietnamese =
middle class is a good thing. And the President will certainly continue t=
o assure the government and the people of Vietnam that the United States =
is serious about implementing the TPP agreement. We recognize that it wou=
ld have a positive impact on the U.S. economy and U.S. strategic interest=
s in the region. We also recognize it would have a positive impact on Vie=
tnams economy and on Vietnams national security as well. We would welcome=
 the deeper ties that would result from an enhanced economic relationship=
.



 Q What about the maritime security cooperation?



 MR. EARNEST: Im confident that will be a part of the discussion, too. Ob=
viously maritime security is quite relevant to the day-to-day security co=
ncerns of the Vietnamese government. And obviously the United States woul=
d like to see those maritime security questions, particularly as it relat=
es to claims on land features in the South China Sea, be resolved through=
 diplomacy and through established international rules of order. So we ce=
rtainly will support that effort, and the President will lend his continu=
ed support to that in the context of this visit.



 Dave, Ill give you the last one.



 Q Thanks, Josh. Susan Rice gave a speech in Florida today in which she s=
aid that the countrys various national security agencies suffer from a la=
ck of diversity. And she said that if the leadership at those agencies wa=
s more diversified they would make better decisions. Does the President a=
gree with that?



 MR. EARNEST: The President certainly believes that our government is mos=
t effective and is making the best decisions when we have a government th=
at looks like the country. And the President has made a concerted effort =
to encourage Americans of all backgrounds to consider a career in public =
service. There are obviously a variety of ways to contribute to our count=
ry. In some cases, that might be joining the military. In some cases, tha=
t may be signing up to be a diplomat to represent U.S. interests around t=
he world. In other cases, that might just be joining civil service and fi=
nding ways to serve in communities all across the country.



 The President believes that our country is strongest when Americans of a=
ll backgrounds both consider that as a career option but also have an opp=
ortunity to be promoted and to be considered for high-ranking positions i=
n those kinds of roles. And those opportunities are I think understandabl=
y and even rightfully given most often to people that have a lot of exper=
ience in those agencies and in that kind of work. So encouraging young pe=
ople as they are considering the start of their career to consider a care=
er in public service isnt just good for the country, its also good for en=
suring over the long term that the senior levels of the U.S. government a=
re filled with government employees that reflect the diversity of America=
.



 Q Talking about senior-level people, she said, minorities still make up =
less than 20 percent of our senior diplomats and less than 15 percent of =
our senior military officers and senior intelligence officials. Given the=
 fact that the President has been President for almost eight years, isnt =
that implicit criticism of his appointments? Is he having trouble finding=
 qualified nominees?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I dont think that she intended it to be implic=
it criticism of the Presidents appointments. I think when you take a look=
 at the effort that the President has undertaken to ensure that we have a=
 government that reflects the diversity of America, weve made historic pr=
ogress in that regard. Weve obviously talked about the Presidents record =
of judicial appointments, and so the President has a record that hes prou=
d of.=20



But let me just go back to this point because I think this is the point t=
hat Susan is trying to make. The best way for us to ensure over the long =
term that the senior ranks of government positions are filled by people w=
ho reflect the diversity of this country is to ensure that as people are =
considering the beginning of their career, that theyre considering a care=
er in public service; that giving more minorities in particular the oppor=
tunity to start a career in public service and rise through the ranks mea=
ns that future Presidents will have a much more diverse pool of applicant=
s to consider when making senior-level appointments, and thats a good thi=
ng. If youre asking somebody to take a senior-level management position i=
n an agency, for example, having agency experience is a good credential t=
o have.=20



 And the President has certainly considered that carefully when he has ma=
de his senior-level appointments. And so when you have a pool of applican=
ts that has a lot of experience in the government and that pool of applic=
ants in more diverse, its going to make it easier for future generations =
or for future U.S. Presidents to have a whole generation of government em=
ployees and civil servants to choose from thats more diverse. And thats a=
 good thing, and that will be good for the long-term strength of our coun=
try.



 I guess the point is, that is an effect that is not going to be felt in =
the short term, and certainly not one that is going to be obviously detec=
ted over the course of just one presidency or even two. But the President=
 is hopeful that 15 or 20 years from now, that a future President will ha=
ve a more diverse pool of applicants to choose from when considering seni=
or-level government appointments.



 Thanks, everybody. Well see you tomorrow.=20

<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Good aft=
ernoon, everybody.&nbsp; We have some brief comments before we get to your =
questions.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to a specific r=
equest that I received yesterday for additional information about the Zika =
virus, I also have a visual aid.&nbsp; You want to put it up there.&nbsp; Y=
ou can see --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that=
 for me?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; It's for=
 everybody, but it certainly is responsive to your request.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier this week, I highli=
ghted the letter from the National Governors Association, urging Congress t=
o work &#8220;as expeditiously as possible&#8221; to ensure that funds are =
available for states, territories and the public at large to combat
 the threat of Zika.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Many of you will recall t=
hat the President convened a meeting with some of his national security tea=
m and our public health professionals back in January to discuss the potent=
ial impact of the Zika virus on the
 United States.&nbsp; That meeting led the President to note in early Febru=
ary that he intended to forward a formal request to Congress for a specific=
 emergency supplemental legislation that would be focused on fighting the Z=
ika virus.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">A couple weeks later, in =
mid-February, the administration put forward that specific proposal to Cong=
ress.&nbsp; That is now almost three months ago.&nbsp; And even though we h=
ad months to get ahead of this emergency, before
 we start to see direct transmission of Zika by mosquitoes in the United St=
ates, Congress has not acted.&nbsp; Congress has basically done nothing to =
act on this specific request for funding that was put forward by the admini=
stration and endorsed by Democratic and

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">As you can see in the gra=
phic behind me, the time to prepare before Zika begins to spread in the con=
tinental United States is rapidly closing.&nbsp; As CDC has said for months=
, based on historical trends, we expect to
 see transmission of Zika from mosquitoes inside the United States starting=
 in June or July.&nbsp; This graphic shows the expected abundance of this m=
osquito and the significant increase in its presence over the summer months=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">As you can clearly see, t=
he threat from the Zika virus is only increasing.&nbsp; The truth is this i=

 take urgent and immediate steps to limit the impact of the Zika virus.<o:p=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">What this graphic clearly=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">As you all are well aware=
, we've been asking Congress to take action since we submitted an emergency=
 budget request in February, and you have heard from the foremost public he=
alth experts in the world about why
 we need this additional funding and why we need it now.&nbsp; We are worki=
ng around the clock.&nbsp; These public health professionals are working ar=
ound the clock.&nbsp; State and local officials are working around the cloc=
k to protect the American public.&nbsp; Congress, however,
 just returned from recess two days ago, and given the threat that this vir=
us poses to American mothers and their babies, Congress should not leave to=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I think the map behin=

 in Congress is woefully insufficient.&nbsp; Under the Republican plan that=
 Republican leaders have just started to discuss is that they may get aroun=

bsp; Well, as you can see from the map that
 would be after the peak of the mosquito season.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a coll=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So be=
fore we get back to Zika, I wanted to ask about reports of the Islamic Stat=
e forces advancing on the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra.&nbsp; That seems =
to put you in an odd position.&nbsp; Are you hoping the Assad
 regime holds the city?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I don't have the latest battlefield assessment to offer here.&nbsp; As we n=
oted at the time, we obviously were pleased to see ISIL give up Palmyra, an=
d the focus of our efforts has been on degrading
 and ultimately destroying that terrorist organization.&nbsp; And we welcom=
ed that development, and we certainly do not want to see ISIL expand the te=
rritory that they control, and we certainly do not want to see ISIL put at =
risk once again such a historically and
 culturally significant city.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given=
 the threat of ISIS reconquering the city and gaining what would be a major=
 strategic victory, is this a situation where the U.S. could conceivably co=
ordinate with Russia, which has provided backup to
 Assad and indirectly to Assad&#8217;s military?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
we have talked for quite some time about the efforts that are currently und=
erway to de-conflict our military activities with Russia in the skies over =
Iraq and in Syria.&nbsp; There have been a number
 of consultations about that.&nbsp; But those consultations have stopped sh=
ort of any sort of formal military cooperation, and I don't anticipate that=
 that will change.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I=
 just wanted to ask you about Iraq.&nbsp; There have been three car bombing=
s in the last 24 hours or so, over 90 people killed.&nbsp; Daesh is claimin=
g responsibility.&nbsp; Are you worried that Daesh is trying to shape
 Baghdad again for a possible assault, as we saw about 18 months ago? <o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
let me just start by saying that the United States strongly condemns the mu=
ltiple attacks in and around Baghdad today.&nbsp; Initial estimates project=
 more than 80 Iraqi citizens have been killed
 in those attacks; many more have been injured.&nbsp; These attacks demonst=
rate the terrorists carry out these abominable attacks without regard to in=
nocent civilian life and in order to stoke tensions between these communiti=
es even further.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We reiterate our solidari=
ty with the Iraqi people against the threat from ISIL.&nbsp; ISIL is a comm=
on enemy to all Iraqis, Americans, and the 65 nations who are part of our c=
ounter-ISIL coalition.&nbsp; By working together,
 the Iraqi people have made important gains against ISIL since 2014, and ev=
ery step the United States has taken is to support the Iraqi government and=
 the Iraqi people as they take back their country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think what is clear fro=
m this incident is that a lot of innocent people have been killed and injur=
ed, and it certainly is consistent with ISIL&#8217;s strategy of wreaking h=
avoc and sowing chaos and violence and sectarian
 tension.&nbsp; And in many cases, they do that by killing innocent people,=
 by targeting them specifically.&nbsp; Those tactics are abhorrent.&nbsp; A=
nd it is a good illustration of exactly what the United States has rallied =
behind the United States to defeat.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And j=
ust lastly, are you worried that the Iraqi government&#8217;s inability to =
provide security in the capital is going to fuel the political instability =
that&#8217;s been going on and which has been hampering critical
 elements of the anti-ISIL offensive such as the Mosul offensive?<o:p></o:p=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
what is clear is that the top priority of the Abadi government is the natio=
nal security of Iraq, and protecting the citizens of Iraq from this sort of=
 violence is the Abadi government&#8217;s top priority.&nbsp;
 The administration, the United States government has been of the strongly =
held view that the Iraqi government is more likely to be successful in secu=
ring the country if they can succeed in uniting that country to face down t=
he threat.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That's what Prime Ministe=
r Abadi has tried to do.&nbsp; He has worked hard across sectarian lines to=
 build diverse support for his government and for the effort to degrade and=
 ultimately destroy ISIL.&nbsp; And that's why
 the United States has found Prime Minister Abadi and the Iraqi central gov=
ernment to be effective partners, and it's why we continue to stand with th=
em as they confront this serious threat.

is that Congress needs to provide Puerto

<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, I'd refer you to the Treasury Department again because Secretary Lew w=
as just there on Monday and he saw a bunch of these negative impacts firsth=
and.&nbsp; And I just relayed the example of him visiting a hospital
 there.&nbsp; That obviously is a pretty graphic illustration of the challe=
nges that Puerto Rico is facing as a result of these budgetary problems.&nb=
sp; And I think they are a good illustration of why Congress needs to act a=
s soon as possible so that we can get to work
 fixing these problems.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't seen the latest t=
ally in terms of the number of Zika cases that have been identified in Puer=
to Rico.&nbsp; But obviously Puerto Rico is under great financial strain.&n=
bsp; Obviously that financial strain is having an impact on their
 ability to invest in their public health system.&nbsp; And given the threa=
t that Zika poses to pregnant women and their babies, now seems like a bad =
time for investments in public health to be undermined.&nbsp; In fact, this=
 is actually a time when we should be redoubling
 our efforts to make sure that we can address cases of the Zika virus quick=
ly and try to prevent it from spreading.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have yo=
u seen any impact in New York or Florida regarding the financial hardship o=
f Puerto Rico?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
mean, I think what we have seen is we certainly have seen an increase in th=
e number of people who are leaving Puerto Rico.&nbsp; I think that is a tes=
tament to the difficult economic challenges that are facing the
 island, and those are not at all unrelated to the budgetary challenges tha=
t are facing the government.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I can't speak to any of =
the specific, tangible impact that we've seen in any of those two states, b=
ut obviously there are a host of concerns that have been raised and that ha=
ve been exacerbated by Congress&#8217;s failure to act promptly
 here.&nbsp; So we know what needs to be done.&nbsp; The administration put=
 forward a proposal back in October, laying out exactly how we could addres=
s these challenges.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, fortunately, there do=
es seem to be a tenacious bipartisan effort underway to try to resolve thos=
e differences.&nbsp; I say &#8220;tenacious&#8221; because we've been talki=
ng about this for a long time, but we haven't actually
 seen any action, but hopefully Democrats and Republicans will both continu=
e to stay engaged in this effort because there&#8217;s a real human toll he=
re that's already being taken as a result of these financial challenges.<o:=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, J=
osh.&nbsp; The President has refrained from weighing in the Democratic prim=

he told Good Morning America that he thought Hillary Clinton would

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I think -- again, I had a chance to take a look at the transcript.&nbsp; Yo=
u&#8217;d have to ask the Vice President&#8217;s office -- I don't think th=
at he was doing much more than just making an observation
 about the math of the race, particularly as it relates to the delegate cou=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does =

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.=
&nbsp; And on Zika, obviously the White House is concerned that Congress is=
n't doing enough to protect Americans. Is there a concern that Brazil isn&#=

 the Olympics, with the continuing problems that we're already starting to =
discuss in Brazil?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
we know that the Zika virus is much more widespread in Brazil than it is in=
 the United States.&nbsp; And we have offered our assistance and support to=
 Brazilian authorities as they try to contain
 this threat.&nbsp; And they obviously are working very hard to ensure that=
 all of the world-class athletes that will be descending upon Brazil can do=
 so safely.&nbsp; And we obviously would be supportive of any effort that t=
hey would undertake to ensure the safety of
 those who are participating in the games.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.=
&nbsp; One last thing on Zika.&nbsp; Senator Flake was saying that $35 mill=

Zika.&nbsp; He points to drunk birds slurring when they sing, some
 people seeing Jesus&#8217;s face on toast, and honeybees on cocaine.&nbsp;=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes, I=
 think it's pretty pathetic when we're facing a significant public health c=
risis, as described by our public health experts, that you would see someon=
e try to distract from what is a pretty important
 issue.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve had an opportunity to meet Senator Flake on a coup=
le of occasions.&nbsp; He&#8217;s an honorable guy and he certainly is the =
kind of person that we would rely on to show some bipartisan leadership, re=
spond to the requests of Democratic and Republican governors,
 respond to the request of public health professionals, and advance the $1.=
9 billion in funding that is needed to confront the Zika virus and do every=
thing we possibly can to protect the American people.&nbsp; So I'll leave i=
t at that.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh,=
 a couple different subjects.&nbsp; First, I want to stay with Zika.&nbsp; =
The World Health Organization says it's just as important as Ebola.&nbsp; W=

 pandemic.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
we've gone to great lengths to help people understand the difference betwee=
n the Zika virus and the Ebola virus.&nbsp; Obviously the --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The l=
evel of concern is such that it's like Ebola.&nbsp; That's what they&#8217;=
re saying.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
again, the viruses are different; the impact that they have on people are d=
ifferent.&nbsp; But given the significant risk that we know the Zika virus =
poses to pregnant women and their babies, we believe
 that urgent action is necessary to do everything we can to try to protect =
the American people, especially pregnant women and their babies.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So there&#8217;s no reaso=
n this has to be a partisan exercise.&nbsp; This should be a common-sense r=
esponsibility that Republicans in Congress should embrace.&nbsp; They ran f=
or Congress so that they could help run the country.&nbsp;
 Running the country means your top priority should be protecting the Ameri=
can people.&nbsp; This is something that Congress can and should do to prot=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And t=
he next question on Zika -- where does this administration weigh in on the =
issues being discussed between health officials about the fact that Zika is=
 such a threat that people, families, may want to delay

</p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I think we would weigh in on this by saying that people should consult thei=
r doctors and that the kinds of decisions that families are making about ei=
ther starting or growing their family are
 decisions that they should make within their family and with the best medi=
cal advice that they can get from their doctors.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Obviously the CDC and the=
 NIH have shared medical information about the risks posed by Zika to pregn=

 much as we possibly can to educate people
 about what exactly those risks are.&nbsp; And I certainly would encourage =
people who are thinking about becoming pregnant to consult the CDC website,=
 to consult their doctor, and understand exactly what the risks are as they=
 make that decision.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So li=
stening to the doctors debate back and forth about it -- does the White Hou=
se view it as an ethical issue not to weigh into that debate?&nbsp; Because=
 you're telling people what to do&nbsp; -- women or husbands,
 wives, or whomever -- about planning a family -- as this is as serious -- =
as you're saying, possible birth defects for those who are pregnant, for th=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I think our desire is for people to have access to the best medical informa=
tion possible as they make these intensely personal decisions.&nbsp; Obviou=
sly the government is not going to be making decisions
 for people, particularly when it comes to something as personal as startin=
g or growing your family.&nbsp; But we do want people to have access to the=
 best information they can get as they make that important and very persona=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And o=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I don't have any comment to share from the President about ongoing litigati=

 firsthand the impact this crisis has had on that

 resources from federal government to help that local community.&nbsp; And =
that's why you&#8217;ve seen millions of dollars in public health grants go=
 to Flint to help doctors and nurses and other public
 health workers there deal with the medical fallout of that crisis situatio=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&#8=
217;t have any calls to announce at this point.&nbsp; But, typically, when =
either the President or the Vice President is in touch with Prime Minister =
Abadi, we read out the call after it's taken place, and I'm sure we'll
 do that in this case, as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given n=
ot just today's violence, but the political crisis that's ongoing in Baghda=
d, I mean, does the White House still believe that Abadi is strong, as the =
Secretary of Defense described him just a week ago?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; The admi=
nistration is still committed -- the U.S. government is still committed to =
supporting Prime Minister Abadi's efforts to reform the political system an=
d to govern that country in an inclusive way.&nbsp; That's going
 to be critical to the ability of Iraq to secure their country and to face =
down the threat that is posed by ISIL.&nbsp; That is the approach that Prim=
e Minister Abadi has pursued, even under unquestionably challenging circums=
tances.&nbsp; And the United States will continue
 to strongly support Prime Minister Abadi and the Iraqi people as they work=
 to unite their country to face down that threat from ISIL.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But do =
you believe a political crisis -- I'm sorry, does the White House believe t=
hat a political crisis is adding to this insecurity that we're seeing on th=
e streets of Baghdad?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
ere's no denying that what we see is a chaotic situation in Iraq.&nbsp; I s=
uspect that the direction of influence, though, is a little more along the =
lines of what Brad laid out, which is that the instability around
 the security situation in Iraq is making governing that country more chall=
enging.&nbsp; And those are the challenging circumstances I was referring t=
o in terms of Prime Minister Abadi's tenure as Prime Minister.&nbsp; So tha=
t certainly is why the United States has been
 so invested -- along with our coalition partners -- in trying to stabilize=
 the -- trying to help the Iraqi government and the Iraqi security forces s=
tabilize the situation inside of Iraq.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">There's a lot of importan=
t progress that we've made over the last almost two years now in driving IS=
IL out of significant populated areas that they used to control, but there =
obviously is a lot more work to be done.&nbsp;
 And there was a reference earlier to the effort to drive ISIL out of Mosul=
, and that will be a tall order.&nbsp; But the United States and our coalit=
ion partners have worked effectively with Iraqi security forces to begin th=
e effort to shape that military strategy.&nbsp;
 And we're going to continue to support Prime Minister Abadi as he pursues =
a governing agenda that reflects the diversity of the nation of Iraq.<o:p><=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I imagi=
ne some of this came out during the NSC meeting yesterday.&nbsp; The govern=
ment spokesperson in Baghdad today said that just 14 percent of territory i=
n Iraq is still under the control of ISIS.&nbsp; Do those numbers sound rig=
ht to
 you?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I haven&=
#8217;t seen that specific statistic.&nbsp; I would encourage you to check =
with the Department of Defense to try to confirm it.&nbsp; The statistic th=
at we've used comes at it from a different perspective.&nbsp; What we have =
said
 is that our coalition, working closely with Iraqi security forces, has dri=
ven ISIL out of about 40 percent of the populated territory that ISIL previ=
ously controlled.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">What that says in terms o=
f the overall percentage of the country, I haven&#8217;t seen a statistic a=
long those lines, so I'd encourage you to check with either the State Depar=
tment or the Department of the Defense to
 try to confirm that specific statement.&nbsp; But I think the statistic th=
at we have confirmed I think does illustrate the important progress against=
 ISIL that's been made.&nbsp; That progress was only possible because of th=
e willingness and courage of Iraqi forces
 that were willing to fight for their country.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the weakness that we =
saw in the Iraqi security forces, back in the summer of 2014, was a symptom=
 of a lack of a willingness to fight for the entire country.&nbsp; There is=
 a part of those Iraqi forces that, based
 on sectarian considerations, left them less willing to defend certain part=
s of their country.&nbsp; And working to pursue a governing agenda, working=
 to diversify Iraq's security forces and to bring them under the command an=
d control of the Iraqi central government
 -- all those are positive steps and all of those have contributed to the p=
rogress that we've against ISIL thus far.&nbsp; And it's a testament to Pri=
me Minister Abadi's leadership that he was able to do that -- again, under =
some very difficult and challenging circumstances.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, look, it's also unders=
tandable that there would be some impatience on the part of the Iraqi peopl=
e and other figures in the Iraqi government about the security situation th=
ere.&nbsp; But Prime Minister Abadi has clearly made this a
 priority.&nbsp; And the American government and the United States military=
 and the 65 nations who are part of our coalition have been strongly suppor=
tive of Prime Minister Abadi's efforts and pleased with the important progr=
ess that's been made over the last year
 and a half or so. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickly=
, on Syrian refugees.&nbsp; Does the President get updates on the numbers o=
f refugees that are being processed into the U.S.?&nbsp; And do you still b=
elieve that 10,000 is roughly the number that are going to be taken in this=
 year?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; The Pres=
ident does receive periodic updates about the progress that's being made to=
 accomplish the goal that he laid out, I believe at the end of last year, t=
o take in 10,000 Syrian refugees during this fiscal year.&nbsp;
 There are reports indicating that we've got some work to do to meet that g=
oal.&nbsp; The President has made clear, both publicly and privately, that =
this is a priority.&nbsp; And the national security officials that are resp=
onsible for implementing this progress understand
 exactly what the Commander-in-Chief's priorities are.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President acknowledged =
at the beginning that this would be a challenging goal to meet, in part bec=
ause individuals who enter the United States through the refugee program ar=
e subjected to more background checks and screening than
 anybody else who enters the United States.&nbsp; And the President was cle=
ar that we would meet this goal without cutting any corners when it comes t=

enge facing those who are implementing this
 program.&nbsp; But the President is serious about meeting this goal, and t=
here's a lot of work to do to make that a reality.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; Interesting piece by David Ignatius in the Post, quoting Direc=
tor Clapper, who said, among other things, about the battle to retake Mosul=
 -- you admitted it's a tall order -- he said he didn&#8217;t think it coul=
d be
 accomplished within the time frame under this administration.&nbsp; How mu=
ch of a surprise is that to you?&nbsp; And is that something that the Presi=
dent anticipated?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, wh=
en the President has talked about this, the President has been focused on t=
he kind of shaping operations that I described earlier.&nbsp; And the goal =
that we've laid out is to try and put in place the conditions by
 the end of the year where Mosul could be retaken.&nbsp; So that is the goa=
l that we're aiming for.&nbsp; Obviously, all of this work is being led by =
the Iraqi central government and the Iraqi security forces, but the United =
States and the rest of the international community
 has bought in on this strategy, and the groundwork is being laid even as w=
e speak.&nbsp; But this is a tall order.&nbsp; This is the second-largest c=
ity in Iraq.&nbsp; So this is going to be a big challenge, but it obviously=
 would be, and will be, a significant strategic
 accomplishment once that city has been retaken.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went=
 on to say that he didn&#8217;t think that the U.S. could fix it -- talking=
 about the grander problems that are prevalent not just on the ground, but =
systematic problems that are there.&nbsp; What does the President think of =
that
 perspective?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; The Pres=
ident agrees wholeheartedly.&nbsp; This is a problem that the Iraqi people =
are going to have to solve when it comes to addressing the challenges in th=
eir own country.&nbsp; We've tried the path of the United States trying
 to impose a solution on these countries that are facing so much turmoil an=
d violence, and that didn&#8217;t work out very well.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t=
 work out very well for the United States; it didn&#8217;t work out very we=
ll for the Iraqi people, either.&nbsp; So we need to pursue
 a strategy where we are empowering the Iraqi government, the Iraqi securit=
y forces, and the Iraqi people to confront successfully the problems that a=
re plaguing their own nation.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the=
 President then, you would say, also agrees with his assessment that we sho=
uld be there because leaving would create a problem as well?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e President believes that, at this point in time, we should be actively sup=
porting the efforts of Prime Minister Abadi to unite his country to face do=
wn the threat from ISIL.&nbsp; We cannot afford to take the risk
 of allowing ISIL to fill a security vacuum.&nbsp; We know that that would =
have a direct and negative impact on the United States' national security.&=
nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we take this quite ser=
iously, and I think it would explain why the President has ordered more tha=
n 12,000 airstrikes against ISIL targets in Iraq and in Syria.&nbsp; It's w=
hy the President has given his military orders
 to implement a strategy to build up the capacity of Iraqi security forces =
to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.&nbsp; It's also why we've pursued t=
he other elements of our strategy to shut down ISIL's financing and stop th=
e flow of foreign fighters, all in an
 effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, because we know that the co=
nsequences of allowing ISIL to establish a safe haven inside of Iraq would =
be dire, both for the United States but for our partners and allies around =
the world.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And bas=
ed on that, should the American people receive that as a message that it's =
going as expected?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think =
the American people can be confident that the Commander-in-Chief understand=
s what's necessary to protect the American people.&nbsp; They can also be c=
onfident that President Obama understands that getting the United
 States directly involved on the frontlines of a ground war in the Middle E=
ast where the United States has committed tens of thousands of ground troop=
s in a combat operation would be a bad idea and contrary to our interests.&=
nbsp; This President --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn&=
#8217;t clear.&nbsp; I meant based on what you were saying -- some of the t=
hings you just pointed had successes.&nbsp; Should the American people then=
 take from that the President feels like it's going as it should be?<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think =
people can be confident that the President recognizes the stakes; that peop=
le can be confident that the President believes that we've made important p=
rogress, but I think we can also be confident, and the American
 people can be confident, that what the President expects to do is to conti=
nue this progress through the eight months that are remaining, and present =
the next President with a path toward accomplishing this broader goal.&nbsp=
;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But it's going to require=
 the United States to continue to support the Abadi-led government that's c=
ommitted to an inclusive agenda, and it's also going to require continuing =
to engage the rest of the international
 community in this effort.&nbsp; This is not something that the United Stat=
es can or will do alone, but we will play a leading role in leading an inte=
rnational coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.&nbsp; And under=
 President Obama's leadership, that's exactly
 what we've done.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last on=
e.&nbsp; Would the President consider backing an idea of partitioning the c=
ountry?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
ere are obviously people that have floated this idea in a variety of contex=
ts, including even the Vice President in his presidential campaign eight ye=
ars ago.&nbsp; What our policy and our belief continues to be is
 that Iraq will be most successful in their fight against ISIL if they can =
succeed in uniting that country to face down the security threat that ISIL =
poses.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that Iraq is str=
onger when it's united.&nbsp; And I think the best evidence that we have of=
 this is that President Abadi's predecessor, Prime Minister Maliki, did pur=
sue a rather sectarian governing agenda, and the vulnerabilities
 in that agenda were laid bare when you saw Iraqi security forces that were=
 charged with protecting that country essentially melt away when ISIL began=
 their initial assault on their country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that's why the President=
 essentially made a precondition of robust U.S. military involvement in the=
 counter-ISIL effort in Iraq that the Iraqi people elect and support a Prim=
e Minister who's committed to reforming the government
 in pursuing the kind of inclusive governing agenda that would unite the co=
untry to face the threat.&nbsp; That's exactly what Prime Minister Abadi ha=
s done.&nbsp; That's why the U.S. government has been supportive of his eff=
orts to do so.&nbsp; And that's why we continue
 to stand with the Iraqi people in this very difficult time.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A coupl=
e of quick ones.&nbsp; Zika -- there was money taken from the emergency fun=
d, right -- the Ebola fund?&nbsp; What is the status of that?&nbsp; And is =
it your position that that money is going to run out soon and that there is=
 no other
 opportunity to tap into that same fund if Congress doesn&#8217;t come up w=
ith something?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Our post=
ure on this has been that using that money was essentially a last resort to=
 try and do as much as we possibly can to protect the American people from =
the Zika virus. But what our public health professionals have
 said, what Dr. Fauci said when he was standing at this podium about a mont=
h or so ago is that that money, about $600 million, was insufficient to fun=
d all of the things that the federal government can and should be doing to =
try to prepare for the onset of
 the Zika virus.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So ther=
e's no more money in that fund?&nbsp; There's no more money available from =
that emergency fund to the administration?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, we=
 can check with OMB on this.&nbsp; I think what it actually is, is that we =
have basically taken as much money as we can from those accounts without un=
dermining the important public health work that they're already
 doing.&nbsp; We didn&#8217;t want to be in a situation where we were essen=
tially eliminating all of the funding to fight Ebola to try to come back an=
d fight Zika, because that would be a pretty unwise decision, as well.&nbsp=
;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So what we've done is bas=
ically taken as much money as we possibly can without totally gutting the E=
bola program to direct it towards Zika.&nbsp; Now, to succeed against Ebola=
, we're going to need that money to be repaid,
 and to be repaid quickly.&nbsp; So we need Congress to act on that, as wel=
l.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want them to think that this is money that was just =
sitting around with nothing to do.&nbsp; The fact is, this is money that wa=
s available that we could use toward Zika without undermining
 the Ebola effort, but we need the Ebola effort to be fully funded, as well=
. And I think everybody who covered this White House in the fall of 2014 wo=
uld acknowledge that we're not going to take Ebola lightly and that that wo=
uld be a bad decision for the country.<o:p></o:p></p>

-- what has been done by the United States to make sure that -- and are you=
 confident that that will not happen again?&nbsp; There were
 reports that Iraqi security forces basically let these protesters in.&nbsp=

l of concern about that embassy, and who is responsible
 for that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
obviously the nation of Iraq has obligations to protect all of the diplomat=
ic facilities on their soil, and we&#8217;ve received assurances from the I=
raqi government that they understand that that&#8217;s
 their obligation.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to that, the St=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ev=
ery nation has an obligation to safeguard the diplomatic facilities that ar=
e on their country&#8217;s soil.&nbsp; The United States, for example, has =
an obligation to ensure the safety and security of foreign diplomats that
 are serving here in the United States.&nbsp; We take that obligation serio=
usly, and we obviously expect that other countries around the world take th=
at obligation seriously.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, of course, at U.S. dip=
lomatic facilities all around the world there are United States Marine Corp=
s servicemembers who are standing guard.&nbsp; And the President takes that=
 security quite seriously, but that certainly does not absolve
 local governments of the responsibility that they have to ensure the safet=
y and security of our diplomats as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One mor=
e.&nbsp; On this issue of the President and the press that&#8217;s been out=
 there lately -- I sent you this this earlier -- the American Presidency Pr=
oject in Santa Barbara -- UC Santa Barbara -- did an analysis that shows th=
at President
 Obama has had fewer press conferences -- is on pace to have fewer press co=
nferences than his previous two predecessors.&nbsp; And the monthly and ave=
rage rate that he&#8217;s been doing these at is less than his three previo=
us predecessors.&nbsp; Is that correct?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think there are a lot of different ways to slice and dice these numbers.&nb=
sp; Obviously the President was just out here five days ago doing a news co=
nference with all of you, standing at this podium.&nbsp; So he does them
 with some regularity.&nbsp; But there are a lot of different ways to slice=
 and dice the numbers here.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the=
y counted press conferences -- formal press conferences, briefing room appe=
arances, joint press conferences with other world leaders.&nbsp; I believe =
it&#8217;s a fairly credible institution.&nbsp; But the point is that, by a=
 couple of
 different measurements, the President has been much less accessible -- les=
s accessible -- I don&#8217;t want to put an adjective in there -- to the p=
ress than his previous predecessors.&nbsp; And, of course, there is still t=
ime to go.&nbsp; But you don&#8217;t see it that way or
 he doesn&#8217;t see it that way?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think the President has done a lot of news conferences.&nbsp; It certainly =
is your job as you sit here in the briefing room and as you cover the Presi=
dent every day to advocate for more access to the President and
 for more news conferences and more opportunities to ask him questions.&nbs=
p; We certainly understand that&#8217;s a part of your job and that&#8217;s=
 part of the give and take that has characterized the relationship between =
the White House and White House press corps for at
 least one century, probably two.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think what is also true i=
s that this President has done more one-on-one interviews with reporters, b=
oth from the White House and from other places, than any of his predecessor=
s.&nbsp; I think that is a testament to the President&#8217;s desire
 to try to engage with independent professional journalists who are interes=
ted in understanding exactly what he&#8217;s doing.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, look, I don&#8217;t ta=
ke any exception to your advocacy for more access to the President.&nbsp; T=
hat certainly is part of your job description.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, i=
s there any White House response to the growing complaints about the TSA an=
d the long lines at airport security checkpoints lately, with the summer tr=
avel season nearing?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. EARNEST:&nbsp; I&#8217;=
m not aware of any specific White House order that&#8217;s been issued on t=
his.&nbsp; I do know that the TSA certainly takes very seriously the respon=
sibility that they have to protect our aviation system, but also to minimiz=
e
 the inconvenience to U.S. travelers.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So they&#8217;re mindful of=
 the responsibility that they have.&nbsp; Certainly some of the challenges =
that they&#8217;re facing right now could be alleviated if they got all of =
the funding that we would like to see them have.&nbsp; So once again, a pro=
blem
 that people have noticed can be traced back pretty directly to the inabili=
ty of Republicans in Congress to govern the country.&nbsp; But what I also =
know that the TSA has done is they&#8217;ve brought on some additional staf=
f, including those with some management expertise,
 to try to address some of these problems, given the resource constraints t=
hat they&#8217;re operating under.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also =
wanted to ask about the national mammal bill that the President signed on M=

 American bison among all other mammals, including people, I guess?&nbsp; (=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ma=
rk, I can tell you -- that&#8217;s an interesting question.&nbsp; Well, I c=
an tell you that there was a robust legislative effort on the part of the W=
hite House on this one.&nbsp; We were determined not to get buffaloed on th=
is.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; But obvi=
ously, this is a piece of legislation that&#8217;s passed through the Congr=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also =
wondered if you saw that New York Times story yesterday about Mrs. Clinton =
promising to get to the bottom of the UFO and Area 51 conspiracies.&nbsp; A=
nd I wondered if the President would like to beat her to the punch by showi=
ng
 his degree of transparency on this issue, which is of concern to a lot of =
Americans.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
is is just part of the regular -- I believe it&#8217;s a bi-weekly meeting =
that the President has with the Secretary of the Treasury.&nbsp; I would an=
ticipate that high on the agenda will be getting a readout from Secretary
 Lew about his trip to Puerto Rico.&nbsp; And I just described to you some =
of what Secretary Lew saw firsthand when he visited Puerto Rico, and I woul=
d anticipate that he&#8217;ll talk with the President about that a little b=
it more as well.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also anticipate tha=
t other budgetary issues will be on the agenda as well.&nbsp; But once that=
 meeting concludes, we&#8217;ll see if we can get you some more details abo=
ut what they discussed.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; Following up on the line of questioning about Brazil, there&#8=
217;s a very real possibility that there could for some time be two Brazili=
an Presidents concurrently, one interim President and one suspended Preside=
nt.&nbsp;
 How would the administration handle relations with Brazil if that does com=
e to pass?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, we=
 obviously would follow the traditions and the laws of Brazil.&nbsp; And, a=
gain, what I understand about this process comes entirely from reading news=
 accounts of what&#8217;s happening there -- or almost entirely of news
 accounts from what&#8217;s happening there.&nbsp; And the way that I under=
stand how this process works is that if the vote in the Senate goes the way=
 that many people are predicting, then President Rousseff would step aside =
while the charges against her are heard by
 the appropriate legislative body.&nbsp; And the current Vice President wou=
ld assume the constitutional powers of the presidency until such time as th=
e allegations against President Rousseff are resolved.&nbsp; That&#8217;s m=
y understanding about the way the process works,
 and the U.S. government and our diplomats who are serving in Brazil would =
engage with the Brazilian government according to their rules and tradition=
s.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And doe=
s this situation provide an opening, potentially, for an improvement of rel=
ations with Brazil?&nbsp; They&#8217;ve been an important partner of the U.=
S., but the government has been in power for over a decade -- the party has=
 been
 in power that was aligned with the U.S. interests.&nbsp; Is there a silver=
 lining here for the U.S. in the disarray of the Brazilian government?<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, li=
sten, President Rousseff was here at the White House a little over a year a=
go, and I think that a hallmark of that visit was effective coordination be=
tween the United States and Brazil on a whole range of issues
 -- everything from the economy to national security to even climate change=
.&nbsp; So we&#8217;ve been able to do a lot of important work with the Bra=
zilian government, and we&#8217;d certainly look for any additional opportu=
nities that are available to cooperate with them
 even further to make progress on priorities that President Obama has ident=
ified.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gardiner.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does th=
e President support Paul Ryan&#8217;s plan to confront the opioid crisis?&n=
bsp; He recently came out with a plan.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
have heard some discussion about their plan.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s a ser=
ies of bills that they have -- I believe it&#8217;s 18 different bills that=
 they&#8217;re considering, none of which actually include any funding, whi=
ch is unfortunate
 and it raises questions about what exactly they hope the impact of these b=
ills would be.&nbsp; I know that there has been some concern expressed by t=
he Speaker&#8217;s office that the political turmoil inside the Republican =
Party is overshadowing this particular legislative
 effort.&nbsp; I think my observation would be, if there were actually some=
 substance behind this legislative effort, it might get some more deserved =
attention.&nbsp; If there were actual funding in here to support more acces=
s to treatment and more evidence-based treatment
 options for people across the country, I suspect it would be worthy of mor=
e public attention.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, unfortunately, that&#8=
217;s not the option that Republicans have chosen.&nbsp; It is particularly=
 unfortunate because the President put forward his own proposal, totaling a=
bout a billion dollars that would make important investments in research
 and treatment and recovery programs.&nbsp; But as you&#8217;ll recall, Gar=
diner, Republicans for the first time in four decades declined to even hear=
 from the President&#8217;s Budget Director about that priority.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Republicans paying lip s=
ervice to an issue that they know is important to voters, without actually =
doing something substantive to address it, and, in fact, actively blocking =
Obama administration efforts to address it is kind of
 an old story, but it&#8217;s the reputation that Republicans have embraced=
 for seven years now and it&#8217;s a reputation that they demonstrate is w=
ell-earned.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to=
 the refugee numbers.&nbsp; The President is hosting a refugee summit in Se=
ptember.&nbsp; It looks like, as you have somewhat admitted, you&#8217;re g=
oing to be way behind on admitting even the small number of Syrian refugees=
 that the
 President has vowed to admit.&nbsp; How is the administration, how is the =
President going to speak with these world leaders and urge them to do more =
when the United States seems to not only have such a paltry goal on Syrian =
refugees to begin with but is probably
 not even going to be close to meeting even that small goal at that point?<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ga=
rdiner, there are several more months left in the fiscal year.&nbsp; And at=
 this point in time in the last fiscal year, there was skepticism about whe=
ther or not the administration would succeed in meeting the goal
 for admitting refugees that we had set for last year.&nbsp; And in the las=
t few months of the fiscal year, the pace ramped up and that goal was met.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This administration is focu=
sed on doing that again, but we will not do that in a way that results in a=
 weakening of security standards.&nbsp; This is a challenging task.&nbsp; I=
ndividuals who enter the United States through the refugee program
 are subjected to more scrutiny, more vetting, and more background checks t=
han anybody else who enters the United States.&nbsp; And the President is d=
etermined to keep those strict security measures in place, even as we ramp =
up the number of people who are admitted
 to the United States.&nbsp; That imposes a significant strain on our syste=
m, but the President is determined to meet that goal.&nbsp; He has made tha=
t clear to his team, and that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re going to c=
ontinue to strive for.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think when you step back =
and look at the longer-term picture in terms of the United States record on=
 the U.N. refugee program, it&#8217;s hard for other countries to criticize=
, particularly when you consider that over the last several
 years the United States has taken in more people through the U.N. refugee =
program than every other nation in the world -- than all the other nations =
in the world combined.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But given the significant c=
risis in Syria, it&#8217;s clear that those efforts need to be expanded not=
 just here in the United States but in other countries around the world.&nb=
sp; And that&#8217;s what the goal of the U.N. meeting will be, will be
 to encourage nations around the world to raise their ambitions when it com=
es to meeting the basic humanitarian needs of people who are fleeing their =
homes to escape violence.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Capi=
tol Hill today there is a meeting -- a hearing about Boko Haram, and one of=
 the people who are testifying is a schoolgirl who was abducted.&nbsp; What=
 the lawmakers are saying is that Boko Haram is the most dangerous terroris=
t
 organization.&nbsp; Does the White House agree with that, or does that hon=
or go to al Qaeda and ISIS?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ob=
viously, the President understands how dangerous Boko Haram is.&nbsp; That =
is why we have devoted significant resources to assisting the Nigerian gove=
rnment and building up their capacity to confront Boko Haram in
 their country.&nbsp; We&#8217;re mindful of that threat, and we understand=
 the terrible violence that they have perpetrated against innocent people n=
ot just in Nigeria but across that region.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the United States contin=
ues to stand with the Nigerian government and the Nigerian people as they f=
ace down this threat. And we&#8217;re mindful of the need to continue to ap=
ply pressure to those extremist organizations, and aren&#8217;t able
 to establish the kind of foothold that would allow them to significantly e=
xpand the territory and people that are affected by their violent acts.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the=
y worse?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, it&#8217;s hard to say.&nbsp; But obviously we take the threat that th=
ey pose quite seriously.&nbsp; This is a terrible, violent extremist organi=
zation, and we&#8217;ve worked hard to support the Nigerian government as t=
hey&#8217;ve
 gone after them.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There w=
ere three suicide bombings in Baghdad today, targeting Shiite Muslims.&nbsp=
; Is it the U.S.&#8217;s responsibility to promote religious liberty in tha=
t region?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e values of the United States are values that we&#8217;re interested in pro=
moting everywhere, and obviously there are different cultures, different se=
curity climates, but we certainly -- the President takes seriously
 the responsibility that our government has to promote our values around th=
e world.&nbsp; And I think that even a casual observer of this situation wo=
uld acknowledge that just a little bit of religious tolerance in this part =
of the world would go a long way to addressing
 the kind of chaos and violence that has stemmed from many of the sectarian=
 atrocities that have been committed.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; A couple of things about the President&#8217;s upcoming trip t=
o Vietnam and Japan.&nbsp; Firstly, on Japan, I understand the President wi=
ll provide a forward-looking vision when he visits Hiroshima.&nbsp; Will th=
e President also
 mention not only about Hiroshima but Nagasaki during the speech or deliver=
 that message?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&#8=
217;t have much of a preview of those comments to share with you at this po=
int.&nbsp; I know that in some places, the President&#8217;s visit to Hiros=
hima was covered as the President planning to give a major speech in Hirosh=
ima.&nbsp;
 That&#8217;s not accurate.&nbsp; When he visits Hiroshima, I would anticip=
ate the President will have an opportunity to reflect on his time there, bu=
t the President does not plan to deliver a major address in Hiroshima.&nbsp=
; But I don&#8217;t have any more details about those
 remarks to share at this point, but as it gets closer, we&#8217;ll keep yo=
u posted.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is =
the President going to deliver the message?&nbsp; In front of the audience =
or just in front of the media outlets?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ou=
r advance team is preparing to arrive in Japan in just a couple of days, so=
 we&#8217;re still working through the logistics and we&#8217;ll keep you p=
osted.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does th=
e President have a plan to visit the Peace Memorial Museum in Hiroshima?<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Again, w=
e&#8217;re still working through the logistics of the President&#8217;s vis=
it, but we&#8217;ll keep you posted.&nbsp; These are all good questions.&nb=
sp; As we get farther down the line of planning the President&#8217;s visit=
, we&#8217;ll be able to
 give you more detail about what the President will see.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Viet=
nam, President Obama will visit Vietnam for the first time and the second v=
isit of a sitting President, I believe.&nbsp; Is there any significant mean=
ing in terms of reconciliation between the two countries, the United States
 and Vietnam?&nbsp; In Ho Chi Minh City, what&#8217;s the plan?&nbsp; What =
is the plan for the President to visit, or what kind of message is the Pres=
ident going to deliver in Saigon?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; The Pres=
ident will spend a couple of days in Vietnam.&nbsp; It is his first trip to=
 Vietnam as President of the United States, and the President will spend ti=
me with the kind of bilateral program that you&#8217;ve come to expect
 when you see the President travel overseas.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll meet with hi=
gh-ranking government officials and spend time talking about the importance=
 of our bilateral relationship.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m confident that will tou=
ch on aspects of our security relationship but also aspects
 of our economic relationship as well.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vietnam has been a part of =
the TPP negotiations, and the prospect of Vietnam taking steps to raise lab=
or, human rights, and environmental standards, and give U.S. businesses mor=
e access to a rapidly growing Vietnamese middle class
 is a good thing.&nbsp; And the President will certainly continue to assure=
 the government and the people of Vietnam that the United States is serious=
 about implementing the TPP agreement.&nbsp; We recognize that it would hav=
e a positive impact on the U.S. economy and
 U.S. strategic interests in the region.&nbsp; We also recognize it would h=
ave a positive impact on Vietnam&#8217;s economy and on Vietnam&#8217;s nat=
ional security as well.&nbsp; We would welcome the deeper ties that would r=
esult from an enhanced economic relationship.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What ab=
out the maritime security cooperation?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I&#8217;=
m confident that will be a part of the discussion, too.&nbsp; Obviously mar=
itime security is quite relevant to the day-to-day security concerns of the=
 Vietnamese government. And obviously the United States would like to
 see those maritime security questions, particularly as it relates to claim=
s on land features in the South China Sea, be resolved through diplomacy an=
d through established international rules of order.&nbsp; So we certainly w=
ill support that effort, and the President
 will lend his continued support to that in the context of this visit.<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dave, I&#8217;ll give you t=
he last one.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; Susan Rice gave a speech in Florida today in which she said th=
at the country&#8217;s various national security agencies suffer from a lac=
k of diversity.&nbsp; And she said that if the leadership at those agencies=
 was more
 diversified they would &#8220;make better decisions.&#8221;&nbsp; Does the=
 President agree with that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; The Pres=
ident certainly believes that our government is most effective and is makin=
g the best decisions when we have a government that looks like the country.=
&nbsp; And the President has made a concerted effort to encourage
 Americans of all backgrounds to consider a career in public service.&nbsp;=
 There are obviously a variety of ways to contribute to our country.&nbsp; =
In some cases, that might be joining the military.&nbsp; In some cases, tha=
t may be signing up to be a diplomat to represent
 U.S. interests around the world.&nbsp; In other cases, that might just be =
joining civil service and finding ways to serve in communities all across t=
he country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President believes that=
 our country is strongest when Americans of all backgrounds both consider t=
hat as a career option but also have an opportunity to be promoted and to b=
e considered for high-ranking positions in those kinds
 of roles.&nbsp; And those opportunities are I think understandably and eve=
n rightfully given most often to people that have a lot of experience in th=
ose agencies and in that kind of work.&nbsp; So encouraging young people as=
 they are considering the start of their career
 to consider a career in public service isn&#8217;t just good for the count=
ry, it&#8217;s also good for ensuring over the long term that the senior le=
vels of the U.S. government are filled with government employees that refle=
ct the diversity of America.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Talking=
 about senior-level people, she said, minorities still make up less than 20=
 percent of our senior diplomats and less than 15 percent of our senior mil=
itary officers and senior intelligence officials.&nbsp; Given the fact that
 the President has been President for almost eight years, isn&#8217;t that =
implicit criticism of his appointments?&nbsp; Is he having trouble finding =
qualified nominees?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, I don&#8217;t think that she intended it to be implicit criticism of t=
he President&#8217;s appointments.&nbsp; I think when you take a look at th=
e effort that the President has undertaken to ensure that we have a governm=
ent
 that reflects the diversity of America, we&#8217;ve made historic progress=
 in that regard.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve obviously talked about the President&#82=
17;s record of judicial appointments, and so the President has a record tha=
t he&#8217;s proud of.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But let me just go back t=
o this point because I think this is the point that Susan is trying to make=
.&nbsp; The best way for us to ensure over the long term that the senior ra=
nks of government positions are filled by
 people who reflect the diversity of this country is to ensure that as peop=
le are considering the beginning of their career, that they&#8217;re consid=
ering a career in public service; that giving more minorities in particular=
 the opportunity to start a career in
 public service and rise through the ranks means that future Presidents wil=
l have a much more diverse pool of applicants to consider when making senio=
r-level appointments, and that&#8217;s a good thing.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re =
asking somebody to take a senior-level management
 position in an agency, for example, having agency experience is a good cre=
dential to have.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the President has certa=
inly considered that carefully when he has made his senior-level appointmen=
ts.&nbsp; And so when you have a pool of applicants that has a lot of exper=
ience in the government and that pool of applicants in more
 diverse, it&#8217;s going to make it easier for future generations or for =
future U.S. Presidents to have a whole generation of government employees a=
nd civil servants to choose from that&#8217;s more diverse.&nbsp; And that&=
#8217;s a good thing, and that will be good for the long-term
 strength of our country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess the point is, that =
is an effect that is not going to be felt in the short term, and certainly =
not one that is going to be obviously detected over the course of just one =
presidency or even two.&nbsp; But the President is hopeful
 that 15 or 20 years from now, that a future President will have a more div=
erse pool of applicants to choose from when considering senior-level govern=
ment appointments.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
