Slow down. Take things off your plate. Find out how to see yourself through YOUR eyes, not everyone else's.

What can Lewis do to support my recovery and self-discovery?

I need room to focus on my own spiritual and emotional conception of our relationship; it's like we're dating again. He should be included in these new adventures when i feel like sharing. Sexual confidence will come with a new, renewed sober connection.

I've been trying to spred my wings and feel like I need to tend to the relationship nest.
