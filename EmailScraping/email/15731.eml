NEW YORK TIMES // EDITORIAL BOARD

All decent people feel sorrow and righteous fury about the latest slaughter=
 of innocents, in California. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies are=
 searching for motivations, including the vital question of how the murdere=
rs might have been connected to international terrorism. That is right and =
proper.

But motives do not matter to the dead in California, nor did they in Colora=
do, Oregon, South Carolina, Virginia, Connecticut and far too many other pl=
aces. The attention and anger of Americans should also be directed at the e=
lected leaders whose job is to keep us safe but who place a higher premium =
on the money and political power of an industry dedicated to profiting from=
 the unfettered spread of ever more powerful firearms.

It is a moral outrage and a national disgrace that civilians can legally pu=
rchase weapons designed specifically to kill people with brutal speed and e=
fficiency. These are weapons of war, barely modified and deliberately marke=
ted as tools of macho vigilantism and even insurrection. America=92s electe=
d leaders offer prayers for gun victims and then, callously and without fea=
r of consequence, reject the most basic restrictions on weapons of mass kil=
ling, as they did on Thursday<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/opinion/tou=
gh-talk-and-a-cowardly-vote-on-terrorism.html>. They distract us with argum=
ents about the word terrorism. Let=92s be clear: These spree killings are a=
ll, in their own ways, acts of terrorism.

Opponents of gun control are saying, as they do after every killing, that n=
o law can unfailingly forestall a specific criminal. That is true. They are=
 talking, many with sincerity, about the constitutional challenges to effec=
tive gun regulation. Those challenges exist. They point out that determined=
 killers obtained weapons illegally in places like France, England and Norw=
ay that have strict gun laws. Yes, they did.

But at least those countries are trying. The United States is not. Worse, p=
oliticians abet would-be killers by creating gun markets for them, and vote=
rs allow those politicians to keep their jobs. It is past time to stop talk=
ing about halting the spread of firearms, and instead to reduce their numbe=
r drastically =97 eliminating some large categories of weapons and ammuniti=
on.

It is not necessary to debate the peculiar wording of the Second Amendment.=
 No right is unlimited and immune from reasonable regulation.

Certain kinds of weapons, like the slightly modified combat rifles used in =
California, and certain kinds of ammunition, must be outlawed for civilian =
ownership. It is possible to define those guns in a clear and effective  wa=
y and, yes, it would require Americans who own those kinds of weapons to gi=
ve them up for the good of their fellow citizens.

What better time than during a presidential election to show, at long last,=
 that our nation has retained its sense of decency?
