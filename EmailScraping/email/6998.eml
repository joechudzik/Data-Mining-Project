In what is a clear contrast to a widely-panned tweet from Donald Trump, the=
 White House has shared a photo of President Obama meeting with 6-year-old =
Sophie Cruz, an activist and child of undocumented immigrants. Cruz is know=
n for her impromptu hug with Pope Francis on his visit to the U.S. last Sep=
tember. She handed the pope a letter calling for him to urge Congress to pa=
ss immigration reform, explaining that both her parents are undocumented wo=
rkers from Mexico. Because of her parent's legal status, they were not perm=
itted to accompany her to the White House for the Cinco de Mayo celebration=
 Thursday. The White House shared photos of both Obama and Vice President J=

For Elizabeth Warren, maybe not running for president wasn't such a bad ide=
a after all. One of the great disappointments for fans of the Massachusetts=

 shy of flat-out telling the Vermont senator -- who has vowed to stay in th=
e race through the convention in July -- it's time for him to bow out. (If =
not that, though, she at the very least made the argument for why she belie=

f Sen. Sanders, right? I am nearly 300 pledged delegates ahead of Sen. Sand=
ers. When I was running against then-Sen. Obama, he and I were neck and nec=
k in the popular vote. Depending on how you counted it, I was a little ahea=
d or he was a little ahead. He was about 60 or so pledged delegates ahead. =
A much, much smaller margin than what we see in this race," Clinton told a =

NEW YORK TIMES // YAMICHE ALCINDOR

Senator Bernie Sanders on Thursday vowed to invest billions of dollars in c=
oal-mining communities to create jobs, seizing on the issue as Hillary Clin=
ton faces a backlash for promising to put coal companies out of business. T=
he Vermont senator brought up the future of coal miners while campaigning a=
cross West Virginia, which holds its primary on Tuesday, and spoke about po=
verty at a food bank in Kimball. Though he trails Mrs. Clinton by hundreds =
of delegates, Mr. Sanders has said that he hopes to close that gap in the r=
emaining contests and has presented himself as more dedicated to helping th=
e middle class than her. On Thursday, Mr. Sanders promised to fight to make=
 sure communities that lose jobs because of his environmental policies woul=
d get help rebuilding their employment base. "While I strongly believe we n=
eed to combat climate change to make our planet habitable for our children =
and our grandchildren, let me be clear: We cannot abandon communities that =
have been dependent on coal and other fossil fuels," he said, according to =
prepared remarks of his speech.

NEW YORK TIMES // NICK CORASANITI

No sooner had Senator Ted Cruz of Texas exited the Republican primary on Tu=
esday night than Hillary Clinton's partisans on social media began calling =
for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to follow suit. Sanders supporters an=
swered those calls with a hashtag that quickly started trending on Twitter:=
 #DropOutHillary. With his victory in Indiana, Mr. Sanders seems all but ce=
rtain to remain in the race for at least another month, taking his insurgen=
t presidential campaign to the California primary on June 7. But there is o=
ne thing he will definitely leave behind if he ultimately abandons the Demo=
cratic nomination fight: an army of online foot soldiers unmatched in size,=
 influence and capabilities, more than ready to join the next battle. The o=

Jesse Benton, a political strategist for former congressman Ron Paul who we=

 charges relating to the 2012 Paul presidential campaign. Benton, alongside=
 two other former aides to the Paul campaign, was found guilty of conspirac=

Donald Trump Reaches Out, Quietly, to Republican Establishment<http://www.n=

NEW YORK TIMES // ASHLEY PARKER

Donald J. Trump, turning his attention to the general election, has begun q=
uietly reaching out to key elements of the Republican establishment as he s=
eeks to unite the party behind his candidacy before his anticipated battle =
against Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump, who is expected to run on a nonideologi=

he understands there are certain norms even he needs to follow as the Repub=

astructure that can sustain a costly general election campaign. His team, a=
lready working to transform a lean operation into a national presidential c=

upporters of her primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont; and p=
lanning to head to Cleveland next week to help direct the party's July conv=

In Donald Trump's Rise, Allies See New American Approach<http://www.nytimes=

NEW YORK TIMES // DAVID SANGER

Alarmed by Donald J. Trump's grip on the Republican presidential nomination=
, world leaders are wrestling with the possibility that, even if he loses t=
he general election, his ascent reflects a strain of American public opinio=
n that could profoundly reshape the way the United States addresses securit=
y alliances and trade. From Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul to the headquarters of=
 NATO in Brussels and the vulnerable Baltic nations along Russia's western =
border, officials and analysts said in interviews that they saw the success=
 of Mr. Trump's "America first" platform as a harbinger of pressure for all=
ies to pay up or make trade concessions in return for military protection. =
In many capitals, Mr. Trump's formal and off-the-cuff foreign policy propos=
als - his threat to pull out of NATO; his musings about removing the United=
 States' nuclear umbrella over Japan and South Korea; his pledge to slap hu=
ge trade tariffs on China - are regarded with a mix of alarm and confusion.=
 Asked on Thursday if Beijing was concerned about the prospect of a Trump p=
residency, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, replied, "We h=
ope the U.S. people from all walks of life would view bilateral relations f=
rom a reasonable and objective perspective."

WASHINGTON POST // JENNA JOHNSON

For his first rally since becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Dona=
ld Trump ventured on Thursday to West Virginia, a state that believed in hi=
m when few did. When Trump flirted with running for president during the la=
st cycle, an April 2011 poll in West Virginia found him tied for first plac=
e with former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who had won the state's nomi=
nating convention three years earlier. When Trump announced his 2016 candid=
acy last June and dominated =ADsocial-media conversations, his highest rate=
 of engagement was in West Virginia. When the race still had three Republic=
an candidates, polls showed that Trump was poised to win at least 60 percen=
t of the vote in the state's primary, which will be held Tuesday. West Virg=
inia's statewide demographics mirror those of the down-on-their-luck towns =
and cities where Trump has hosted many of his campaign rallies. The state h=
as a median annual household income of $41,576 - nearly $12,000 less than t=

Restoring Bathroom Sanity in North Carolina<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/=
06/opinion/restoring-bathroom-sanity-in-north-carolina.html?ref=3Dopinion>
NEW YORK TIMES // EDITORIAL BOARD
The Department of Justice has given Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina unti=
l Monday to abandon the state's discriminatory law barring transgender peop=
le from using public restrooms based on their gender identity. The law also=
 blocked Charlotte's antidiscrimination ordinance, and prohibited cities an=
d counties from enacting similar laws. In a letter issued Thursday, the Jus=
tice Department's top civil rights prosecutor, Vanita Gupta, warned the gov=
ernor that the statute, which was passed in March, violates federal civil r=
ights law. She said that the Department of Justice may sue North Carolina a=
nd that the Department of Education may withhold federal funding for its sc=
hools. The state law peddles the malicious idea that transgender people are=
 sexual predators and that allowing people to use a bathroom that reflects =
their gender identity violates the rights of others. It immediately drew a =
strong backlash from civil rights groups, religious leaders and businesses.=
 Major corporations have decried the law, calling it an impediment to recru=
iting and retaining top talent. Employers have already suspended plans to e=
xpand operations in North Carolina, costing the state hundreds of jobs.

ith political experience, to be his running mate as he shifts toward the ge=
neral election. The real estate mogul has boasted about
 his business chops, insisting he would be a strong president for the econo=

 president with congressional connections and experience to help pass his a=
genda. On Thursday, the presumptive
 Republican presidential nominee set the odds that his running mate will be=
 a former rival, suggesting during an interview with CNBC that there is &#8=

 candidates who ran against him for president.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">For his first rally since becoming the presumptive=
 Republican nominee, Donald Trump ventured on Thursday to West Virginia, a =
state that believed in him when few did. When Trump flirted
 with running for president during the last cycle, an April 2011 poll in We=
st Virginia found him tied for first place with former Arkansas governor Mi=
ke Huckabee, who had won the state&#8217;s nominating convention three year=
s earlier. When Trump announced his 2016
 candidacy last June and dominated =ADsocial-media conversations, his highe=
st rate of engagement was in West Virginia. When the race still had three R=
epublican candidates, polls showed that Trump was poised to win at least 60=
 percent of the vote in the state&#8217;s
 primary, which will be held Tuesday. West Virginia&#8217;s statewide demog=
raphics mirror those of the down-on-their-luck towns and cities where Trump=
 has hosted many of his campaign rallies. The state has a median annual hou=
sehold income of $41,576 &#8212; nearly $12,000
 less than the national figure &#8212; and more than 18 percent there live =
in poverty, one of the highest rates in the country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The Department of Justice has given Gov. Pat McCrory=
 of North Carolina until Monday to abandon the state&#8217;s discriminatory=
 law barring transgender people from using public restrooms based on their =
gender identity. The law also blocked Charlotte&#8217;s
 antidiscrimination ordinance, and prohibited cities and counties from enac=
ting similar laws. In a letter issued Thursday, the Justice Department&#821=

 statute, which was passed in March, violates
 federal civil rights law. She said that the Department of Justice may sue =
North Carolina and that the Department of Education may withhold federal fu=
nding for its schools. The state law peddles the malicious idea that transg=
ender people are sexual predators
 and that allowing people to use a bathroom that reflects their gender iden=
tity violates the rights of others. It immediately drew a strong backlash f=
rom civil rights groups, religious leaders and businesses. Major corporatio=
ns have decried the law, calling
 it an impediment to recruiting and retaining top talent. Employers have al=
