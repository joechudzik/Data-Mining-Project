Trump=E2=80=99s income tax returns once became public. They showed he didn=
=E2=80=99t pay a
cent.

Washington Post | Drew Harwell

The last time Donald Trump=E2=80=99s income-tax returns were made public, t=
he
bottom line was striking: He had paid the federal government $0 in income
taxes.

The disclosure, in a 1981 report by New Jersey gambling regulators,
revealed that the wealthy Manhattan investor had for at least two years in
the late 1970s taken advantage of a tax-code provision popular with
developers that allowed him to report negative income.

Today, as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Trump regularly
denounces corporate executives for using loopholes and =E2=80=9Cfalse deduc=
tions=E2=80=9D
to =E2=80=9Cget away with murder=E2=80=9D when it comes to avoiding taxes.

=E2=80=9CThey make a fortune. They pay no tax,=E2=80=9D Trump said last yea=
r on CBS. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s
ridiculous, okay?=E2=80=9D

The contrast highlights a potentially awkward challenge for Trump.

He has built a political identity around his reputation as a financial
whiz, even bragging about his ability to game the tax code to pay as little
as possible to the government =E2=80=94 a practice he has called the =E2=80=
=9CAmerican
way.=E2=80=9D Moreover, he has aggressively pursued tax breaks and other go=
vernment
supports to bolster his real estate empire. But that history threatens to
collide with his efforts to woo working-class voters who resent that they
often pay higher tax rates than the wealthy who benefit from special
loopholes.

Trump=E2=80=99s personal taxes are a mystery. He has refused to release any=
 recent
returns, meaning the public cannot see how much money he makes, how much he
gives to charity and how aggressively he uses deductions, shelters and
other tactics to shrink his tax bill.

Trump, who said last week on ABC that his tax rate is =E2=80=9Cnone of your
business,=E2=80=9D would be the first major party nominee in 40 years to no=
t
release his returns.

In an interview this week, Trump said that he has paid =E2=80=9Csubstantial=
=E2=80=9D taxes
but declined to provide specifics.

He reiterated that he fights =E2=80=9Cvery hard to pay as little tax as pos=
sible.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9COne of the reasons is because the government takes your money and =
wastes
it in the Middle East and all over the place,=E2=80=9D he said.


Trump=E2=80=99s contradictory approaches have been apparent for years.

He criticized the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, for delaying the
release of his returns. Romney, a former private-equity executive, had come
under fire for paying a low tax rate because most of his income came from
investments.

=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s a great thing when you can show that you=E2=80=99ve b=
een successful, and that
you=E2=80=99ve made a lot of money,=E2=80=9D Trump said at the time.

Romney eventually released returns showing that, for his 2011 taxes, he
chose not to take certain deductions, bringing his tax rate more in line
with that of average Americans.

Trump, early in his campaign, seemed ready to give voters a look at his tax
filings.

In January, he said on NBC=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CMeet the Press=E2=80=9D that =
he was ready to disclose
his =E2=80=9Cvery big . . . very beautiful=E2=80=9D returns.

But as his campaign gained momentum, Trump backed away from his promise. He
first claimed that ongoing audits by the Internal Revenue Service prevent
disclosure.

Then last week, he told the Associated Press that voters are not interested
in seeing his tax filings and that =E2=80=9Cthere=E2=80=99s nothing to lear=
n from them.=E2=80=9D

Trump=E2=80=99s new position has unnerved some tax experts, who see value i=
n the
tradition of transparency by presidential contenders.

=E2=80=9CAt some point, he could be the tax-collector-in-chief. He=E2=80=99=
d supervise the
IRS, making sure all of us live up to our own tax responsibilities,=E2=80=
=9D said
Joe Thorndike, a director at Tax Analysts, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group
that specializes in tax policy. =E2=80=9CPeople deserve to know . . . how a=
 person
like that plays the game.=E2=80=9D

Trump=E2=80=99s stance has become an issue in the campaign.

Romney said on Facebook last week that refusing to release the returns
should be =E2=80=9Cdisqualifying=E2=80=9D for any nominee and speculated th=
at Trump=E2=80=99s
returns could be hiding a =E2=80=9Cbombshell of unusual size.=E2=80=9D

Trump=E2=80=99s likely Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who has disclo=
sed
decades of tax returns, released a 60-second ad last week asking, =E2=80=9C=
What=E2=80=99s
Donald Trump hiding?=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=99ve got to ask yourself: =E2=80=98Why doesn=E2=80=99t h=
e want to release it?=E2=80=99 =E2=80=9D Clinton
said at a New Jersey rally last week. =E2=80=9CYeah, well, we=E2=80=99re go=
nna find out.=E2=80=9D


Bob McIntyre of the liberal group Citizens for Tax Justice suspects Trump=
=E2=80=99s
tax returns, if made public, would undermine the political image the
candidate has crafted of a brilliant businessman with what his campaign has
called =E2=80=9Ctremendous cash flow.=E2=80=9D

Trump may be worried that =E2=80=9Che=E2=80=99d show very little income on =
his tax returns
compared to his wealth claims,=E2=80=9D McIntyre said, adding that Trump=E2=
=80=99s returns
could also show that he =E2=80=9Cwrites off everything he has in his life =
=E2=80=94 the
hairdo, the plane =E2=80=94 as business expenses.=E2=80=9D

Trump has repeatedly said that he would be open to sharing his returns. In
2011, he said he would release them after Barack Obama released his
long-form birth certificate but never did after the certificate=E2=80=99s r=
elease.
In 2014, he said he would =E2=80=9Cabsolutely=E2=80=9D release them =E2=80=
=9Cif I decide to run for
office.=E2=80=9D Last year, he said he would release them when =E2=80=9Cwe =
find out the
true story on Hillary=E2=80=99s emails.=E2=80=9D

To back his refusal, Trump has released a letter from his tax lawyers that
said his tax returns had been audited by the IRS since 2002, and that
audits on the returns since 2009 were still underway.

The lawyers=E2=80=99 letter also said returns from 2002 to 2008 had been cl=
osed
administratively by the IRS, meaning their audits had been completed. Trump
said in an interview he would still not release those returns because
=E2=80=9Cthey=E2=80=99re all linked.=E2=80=9D

But experts say that Trump is free to release his tax records. President
Richard Nixon released his returns while under audit. Nothing, including an
audit, =E2=80=9Cprevents individuals from sharing their own tax information=
,=E2=80=9D an
IRS spokesman said.

The only window into Trump=E2=80=99s handling of his income taxes came duri=
ng the
1981 New Jersey report after Trump=E2=80=99s application for a casino licen=
se.

State records show that Trump claimed that his combined income in 1978 and
1979 was negative $3.8 million, allowing him to pay no taxes. A few years
earlier, he had told the New York Times he was worth more than $200 million=
.

Tax analysts say it is possible that Trump pays very low income taxes, or
no taxes at all, using tactics available to wealthy investors and
developers, such as depreciating the value of real estate.

When asked this week whether he pays income taxes, Trump said, =E2=80=9CI w=
ill give
that to you as soon as I get my audit finished.=E2=80=9D He added later, =
=E2=80=9CBut with
that being said, when you=E2=80=99re in the real estate business, you do ha=
ve
certain tax advantages.=E2=80=9D

Trump has benefited from public money by aggressively seeking large tax
reductions at developments including Trump Tower.

His first major development, the Grand Hyatt Hotel in midtown Manhattan
built in partnership with Chicago=E2=80=99s wealthy Pritzker family, was ma=
de
possible with the help of a New York City tax subsidy worth $400 million
over 40 years, according to city records.

It was New York=E2=80=99s first-ever tax abatement for a commercial propert=
y,
secured by Trump with help from his developer father=E2=80=99s political al=
lies,
according to =E2=80=9CThe Deals and the Downfall,=E2=80=9D a biography on T=
rump=E2=80=99s
developments by investigative reporter Wayne Barrett.

Trump has defended his use of public tax assistance to boost private
projects. He said opponents of such government supports, including some
conservatives, are out of touch with reality.

=E2=80=9CThe true conservative philosophy is that a thing like that shouldn=
=E2=80=99t
happen. But they=E2=80=99re in the world of the make-believe,=E2=80=9D Trum=
p said in an
interview. =E2=80=9CThe real world is that without certain tax abatements, =
you have
a choice. The job could get built . . . or you don=E2=80=99t have to have a=
nything.
It could just go stagnant, and a town can die.=E2=80=9D

Trump=E2=80=99s strategy to ease his company=E2=80=99s tax burden has resul=
ted in sore
feelings in some communities, where local governments rely heavily on tax
receipts from large businesses.

In Ossining, N.Y., home to a Trump National Golf Club, town officials say
that a tax break being sought by the company would cost their coffers more
than $200,000 a year.

In seeking the reduction, Trump=E2=80=99s lawyers have claimed that the clu=
b is
worth far less than the roughly $15 million value assessed by the city.

Trump=E2=80=99s lawyers have filed papers with the state claiming that the =
=E2=80=9Cfull
market value=E2=80=9D of the property is $1.4 million. The same golf course=
 appears
on Trump=E2=80=99s new financial disclosure form released this week as part=
 of his
presidential campaign =E2=80=94 valued by him at more than $50 million.

Trump lawyer Alan Garten did not respond to questions about the discrepancy=
.

Ossining Town Supervisor Dana Levenberg, a Democrat, expressed frustration
that Trump seemed to be gaining =E2=80=9Cat other people=E2=80=99s loss.=E2=
=80=9D

=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s hard to look at someone who talks about their wealth =
frequently and
think they got that successful on other people=E2=80=99s backs,=E2=80=9D sh=
