Apparently a woman was about to be hired as California state director for Trump and then Manafort passed her over for one of his people.


Revealed: inside the tug of war to run Donald Trump's California campaign<http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/28/donald-trump-california-primary-campaign-power-struggle-tim-clark>
The Guardian - Paul Lewis

Tim Clark was asked if he was interested in running Donald Trump's campaign in California earlier this month. "Interested?" he recalls telling an emissary for the Republican frontrunner. "You bet I'm interested. I'm about to fall out of my chair."

Clark could have been forgiven for assuming the job of Trump's state director in California, the most delegate-rich primary contest, and the one likely to determine the outcome of the 2016 Republican race, would involve being thrust into the billionaire's inner circle.

Yet more than two weeks into the role, Clark has still not met with Trump or even spoken with him on the phone. "I haven't talked to him," he conceded, when pressed over the extent of his communications with the Republican frontrunner. "There's been, you know, email traffic and things like that."

The fact Trump has yet to talk to the strategist in command of the all-important California primary contest may say more about the frontrunner's centralized presidential campaign than it does about Clark.


On the other hand, it turns out Clark was not an uncontroversial pick.

Stuart Jolly, who until recently was Trump's national field director, said he considered Clark for the role but decided he was unqualified.

"I had already ruled him out," he said.

Jolly said he was overruled by a more senior campaign operative, but maintains that Clark's selection over another contender in California was "almost laughable".

Others, including some of the most prominent figures in California Republican politics, maintain that Clark is more than capable of running Trump's operations in the state, even if he currently finds himself on the margins.

Either way, the inside story of how Clark got the job sheds new light on the internal power struggle that has rocked the Trump campaign in recent weeks.

For his part, Clark, who granted the Guardian a wide-ranging interview in his small office overlooking the I-80 highway in Auburn, California, said Trump's team was fully invested in his plan for winning the California primary on 7 June.

While he had not spoken his Trump, who is traveling to California to launch his campaign in the state on Thursday, Clark said he had received "direct feedback" in email form "so we've had some interactions".

"I appreciate the fact that Mr Trump has reviewed my bio and found me to be somebody that he would like to hire," Clark said, smiling. "You watch some of the episodes of The Apprentice and you say: 'OK, alright, I'm good, I'm not going to take that elevator ride down'."

A political power struggle
Clark was not the first choice to run Trump's crucial campaign in California, the last state to vote and, almost certainly, the place the Republican frontrunner will either secure the requisite number of delegates for the nomination or fall short.

Trump's campaign began its search in late March, several weeks after his rivals had selected prominent political figures to spearhead their California campaigns.

Ted Cruz had opted for Ron Nehring, a former chairman of the California state GOP and well-known face on CNN, to chair his campaign in the state. Soon after, John Kasich announced his California campaign chairman would be the Silicon Valley entrepreneur and ex-gubernatorial candidate Steve Poizner.

At first, it appears to have been the Republican operative Jimmy Camp who was approached about a role in the Trump campaign. But Camp politely declined the offer.


The problem, he told the Guardian this week, was the candidate.

"I've actually been pretty vocal in my opposition to Trump," he said. "I'm not a fan. I think he's deathly for our party and for our country and I'm actually doing everything I can to stop him."

Second in line for the job was Kathy Tavoularis, statewide director to Arnold Schwarzenegger's re-election campaign and director of California's delegation to the Republican convention in 2012.

Tavoularis was open to the job and interviewed and vetted by Jolly, who had selected every one of Trump's other statewide directors. Jolly confirmed that he considered Clark but concluded there was no comparison.

"I just didn't think he was as qualified as Kathy," he said. "She had much more experience in delegate work, she had more experience statewide."

Jolly said, in early April, he was on the cusp of offering Tavoularis the job, adding: "She was so much more qualified it was almost laughable, in my opinion."

However a power struggle was under way at Trump's campaign headquarters between the businessman's campaign manager and close confidante, Corey Lewandowski, and Paul Manafort, a veteran political bruiser who had been appointed convention manager.

"Manafort wanted to have full reign over California and asked me to let him [select the director] for California," Jolly said. "I was probably within the hour of offering the job to Kathy. Literally, a day later, Kathy would have been state director."

Why was Manafort so keen to go with Clark? "He just wanted his people [in California]," said Jolly, who resigned from the Trump campaign last week. "It's politics. Everyone wants their guy there."

An uphill battle to gain allies
Some 3,000 miles away, Clark was apparently oblivious to political tug of war at Trump headquarters that was about to land him the job of lifetime.


The 49-year-old gave up consultancy work last year for the slower-paced job in Sacramento, working as chief of staff to a state legislator he helped get elected.

He believed he had been recommended as a suitable candidate to Trump's campaign. "It sounds like there were those in the industry that said, you need to go to get Tim," he said.

It cannot have harmed Clark that, a month earlier, he declared himself a Trump supporter in an op-ed in the Sacramento Bee. Clark parted company with the Republican establishment in the article, arguing his "track record of abrasiveness" was actually an electoral asset in an era when conservative voters wanted something new.


Clark said he received the call on 8 April from "a representative of Mr Manafort" asking if he wanted the job.

The process thereafter was remarkably quick. Clark sketched a roadmap to victory for Trump in California and had a series of calls over the weekend with real estate mogul's advisers in New York. By Monday morning, he said, the job was his.

When the announcement was made, two days later, there was consternation among some Republican political strategists in the state.

"Overall, in general, people just don't want to work with Tim," said one such Republican political operative, who said Clark had been involved in disagreements with other consultants. "He's a nice guy, not unpleasant, but he's burned a lot of bridges."

The operative was one of three GOP consultants who told the Guardian they would not work with Clark - although none would go on the record.

Some might put that criticism down to professional jealousy, or dismay that Clark opted to back the controversial frontrunner.

Clark may be lower-profile than the figures running the Cruz and Kasich campaigns, but he does have a track record of winning elections. One notable success was the triumph of Fresno's Republican mayor, Ashley Swearengin, a rising start in the small world of conservative politics in California.

"Tim is a bright guy, he's got a good record and he can help the delegate-selection effort," said Rob Stutzman, a GOP operative leading a major anti-Trump effort in California. Stutzman did, however, question how central a role Clark would play in Trump's notoriously centralized campaign.

Jim Brulte, the current chairman of the California Republican Party, who is staying neutral in the race, said Clark was "absolutely" qualified for the job.

He pointed out that in addition to his success in local races, Clark was involved in one of only two statewide Republican non-incumbent victories in the overwhelmingly Democratic state in recent years: the election of Poizner as state insurance commissioner in 2006.

Poizner also complimented Clark, saying he was "one of the key strategists" in his successful election 10 years ago.

"It is very difficult to run statewide in California," Poizner said. "In addition, if you are a Republican, it is 10 times harder."

Plotting a roadmap to victory

Winning a statewide Republican primary, of course, is less of a challenge, not least when your candidate has the momentum currently powering Trump, who registered overwhelming victories in five eastern states on Tuesday.

Clark provided a glimpse of how he planned to pull off a similar victory in California. He pulled out a map and showed how he has divided California into five regions, each of which will have campaign offices opening next week. He said Trump would spend more time in California than all other primary states, except Iowa and New Hampshire.


"I put together, based on what I know of the state, a budget that I believe will win 172 [delegates]," he said. "That's my goal. I presented that to the guys back east. I feel very strongly that the team in New York, and Mr Trump, who heads that team, understands what it takes to win California."

Clark appeared to hedge over whether that would involve big spending in California's notoriously expensive media market.

"There's some elections that transcend paid media," he said. "What new thing can be said about Donald Trump to these voters in California? Because it's not as if they've shut off their TVs and haven't been paying attention for the last year."

Clark suggested the campaign probably would spend lavishly on TV ads, but also cast doubt on the wisdom of that approach.

"Will the Trump campaign have a vigorous paid media? Yeah, I expect so," he said. "Will the other side? Yeah, I expect so. Will it have any impact? I don't know, I don't think so. So our campaign is built to anticipate that it will [have an impact], but it won't."

With the California GOP primary limited to registered Republicans, Clark said a key part of his strategy was convincing former Republicans who switched to independents to change their registration. With mail-in ballots arriving with California voters soon, he acknowledged he had limited time to do so, but insisted the strategy made sense.

"That type of voter is very attracted to Mr Trump's independence," he said, adding that the tactic would "fundamentally change the voter-equation" in the 53 congressional districts that award delegates.

"All the models that the Cruz people have, all the models that the Kasich people have, we're blowing them up right now by changing the population of who is available to vote," he said.

Clark did not rule out Spanish-language TV ads or robocalls on behalf of the presidential candidate who has likened Mexicans to "rapists" and "criminals".

"It is a strategy point that we have to keep internal right now," he said.

He exuded unequivocal confidence in Trump, pointing out a recent Fox poll gave Trump a huge, 27-point lead over Cruz.

"We've tried it with the smooth politician, we've tried it with the congenial politician, and it has got us very little," he said. "It is time to try it with a guy who will just get in and fight."

Later, in an email exchange, Clark confirmed he would have an opportunity to speak with his boss for the first time on Thursday, when Trump flies into Los Angeles for a major rally in the suburbs of Orange County.

"Yes," he wrote. "I'll be seeing Mr Trump tomorrow."

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;Tim is a bright guy, he&#8217;s got a good record and he can help the delegate-selection effort,&#8221; said Rob Stutzman, a GOP operative leading a major anti-Trump effort in California. Stutzman did, however, question how central a role Clark would
 play in Trump&#8217;s notoriously centralized campaign.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jim Brulte, the current chairman of the California Republican Party, who is staying neutral in the race, said Clark was &#8220;absolutely&#8221; qualified for the job.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He pointed out that in addition to his success in local races, Clark was involved in one of only two statewide Republican non-incumbent victories in the overwhelmingly Democratic state in recent years: the election of Poizner as state insurance
 commissioner in 2006.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Poizner also complimented Clark, saying he was &#8220;one of the key strategists&#8221; in his successful election 10 years ago.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;It is very difficult to run statewide in California,&#8221; Poizner said. &#8220;In addition, if you are a Republican, it is 10 times harder.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Plotting a roadmap to victory<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Winning a statewide Republican primary, of course, is less of a challenge, not least when your candidate has the momentum currently powering Trump, who registered overwhelming victories in five eastern states on Tuesday.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Clark provided a glimpse of how he planned to pull off a similar victory in California. He pulled out a map and showed how he has divided California into five regions, each of which will have campaign offices opening next week. He said
 Trump would spend more time in California than all other primary states, except Iowa and New Hampshire.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;I put together, based on what I know of the state, a budget that I believe will win 172 [delegates],&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s my goal. I presented that to the guys back east. I feel very strongly that the team in New York, and Mr Trump, who heads
 that team, understands what it takes to win California.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Clark appeared to hedge over whether that would involve big spending in California&#8217;s notoriously expensive media market.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;There&#8217;s some elections that transcend paid media,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What new thing can be said about Donald Trump to these voters in California? Because it&#8217;s not as if they&#8217;ve shut off their TVs and haven&#8217;t been paying attention for the last
 year.&#8221; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Clark suggested the campaign probably would spend lavishly on TV ads, but also cast doubt on the wisdom of that approach.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;Will the Trump campaign have a vigorous paid media? Yeah, I expect so,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Will the other side? Yeah, I expect so. Will it have any impact? I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t think so. So our campaign is built to anticipate that it will [have
 an impact], but it won&#8217;t.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With the California GOP primary limited to registered Republicans, Clark said a key part of his strategy was convincing former Republicans who switched to independents to change their registration. With mail-in ballots arriving with California
 voters soon, he acknowledged he had limited time to do so, but insisted the strategy made sense.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;That type of voter is very attracted to Mr Trump&#8217;s independence,&#8221; he said, adding that the tactic would &#8220;fundamentally change the voter-equation&#8221; in the 53 congressional districts that award delegates.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;All the models that the Cruz people have, all the models that the Kasich people have, we&#8217;re blowing them up right now by changing the population of who is available to vote,&#8221; he said.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">Clark did not rule out Spanish-language TV ads or robocalls on behalf of the presidential candidate who has likened Mexicans to &#8220;rapists&#8221; and &#8220;criminals&#8221;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">&#8220;It is a strategy point that we have to keep internal right now,&#8221; he said.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He exuded unequivocal confidence in Trump, pointing out a recent Fox poll gave Trump a huge, 27-point lead over Cruz.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;We&#8217;ve tried it with the smooth politician, we&#8217;ve tried it with the congenial politician, and it has got us very little,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is time to try it with a guy who will just get in and fight.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Later, in an email exchange, Clark confirmed he would have an opportunity to speak with his boss for the first time on Thursday, when Trump flies into Los Angeles for a major rally in the suburbs of Orange County.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be seeing Mr Trump tomorrow.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></p>
