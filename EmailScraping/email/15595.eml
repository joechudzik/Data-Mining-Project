A closer look at Wisconsin=92s economy under Gov. Scott Walker<http://thehi=

sconsins-economy-under-gov-scott>
The Hill Opinion// Former Minneapolis Mayor and DNC Vice Chair R.T. Rybak

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is looking for a new job but, unfortunately, so=
 are too many of his constituents.

After running on the promise to create 250,000 new private sector jobs by t=
he end of his first term, Walker didn=92t just fail to meet this goal, he f=
ailed miserably, creating barely half of his promised amount.

Walker has implemented a failed economic strategy, based on basic and faile=
d Republican economic principals, that has left Wisconsin lagging behind pe=
er states.

Even just a glance at economic metrics in Wisconsin tells a story of stifle=
d job growth, ballooning deficits, and a shrinking middle class.

When looking for reasons why Walker may have failed so miserably at creatin=
g jobs in Wisconsin, the obvious place to look would be his flagship job cr=
eation agency: The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC). WEDC,=
 which Walker chaired, gave out taxpayer-funded loans to hundreds of compan=
ies in the hopes of spurring growth. But the jobs Walker promised never mat=
erialized. Instead, in an epic display of mismanagement, WEDC lost track of=
 millions of dollars in loans, gave awards to ineligible businesses, and ha=
s generally been a poor steward of taxpayers=92 money.

In terms of job growth, Wisconsin has consistently trailed the national ave=
rage. In fact, Wisconsin only saw 1.5 percent private-sector job growth in =
2014. Unfortunately for Wisconsinites, while this is the best job creation =
number Walker has seen throughout his entire time in office, it lags far be=
hind the national growth rate of 2.6 percent.

But none of this should come as a surprise. Instead of fulfilling his promi=
se to create jobs, Walker has chosen to prioritize attacking public workers=
 and teachers. All this did was create a culture of polarization that has d=
ivided his state to the core.

How big a failure have Walkernomics been? Just look next door at Democratic=
 Gov. Mark Dayton=92s Minnesota, which leads Wisconsin in almost every econ=
omic indicator.

In Minnesota, Dayton turned a $5 billion budget deficit into an over $1 bil=
lion budget surplus in just one term. By requiring the wealthiest earners t=
o pay their fair share, Minnesota is now in a position to invest more resou=
rces into the state=92s schools and infrastructure.

In Wisconsin, Walker was unable to take his state out of the red and faced =
a $2 billion budget deficit. Walker made the decision to cut taxes for mill=
ionaires and billionaires, while slashing education funding and refusing to=
 make investments that would benefit middle class families and Wisconsin=92=
s financial wellbeing.

In Minnesota, Dayton has moved forward Democratic policies like increasing =
the minimum wage, expanding Medicaid, and investing in the middle class, an=
d now we are seen as one of the most business friendly states in the countr=
y. Just this year, Forbes ranked Minnesota as the 9th best state for busine=
ss and careers, 7th in economic climate and 2nd in quality of life. On top =
of all that, CNBC just ranked Minnesota the country=92s top state for busin=
ess in 2015.

In Wisconsin, Walker refuses to raise the minimum wage and equal pay legisl=
ation, rejected federal funds to expand Medicaid, and attacked Wisconsin wo=
rkers with right to work legislation and anti-collective bargaining policie=
s. As a result, the cost of doing business in Wisconsin is higher than the =
national average, and median household income in Wisconsin is thousands of =
dollars less than it is in Minnesota.

While Dayton has clearly reformed Minnesota and put our state on a path to =
economic prosperity, Walker has reformed Wisconsin for the worse. So if Wal=
ker wants to run on a platform of his reforms and economic growth, what exa=
ctly does he have to brag about?

Walker and other Republican governors running for president like to say the=
ir credentials as a governors make them most qualified to be president. But=
 in reality, those credentials amount to failed job creation, tax cuts for =
the wealthy, and ballooning deficits. Not so presidential in my opinion.
