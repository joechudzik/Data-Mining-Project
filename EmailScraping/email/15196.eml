Subject: VPOTUS Pool Report #4

The motorcade rolled up to the headquarters of Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream =
in the Arena District of Columbus, Ohio, at 2:20 p.m.

The pool was escorted through a separate entrance, so your pooler did not=
 catch a glimpse of VP Biden's arrival. The pool was ushered into an open=
 space next to a kitchen where roughly 55 people were seated, a mix of em=
ployees and workers' advocates, according to the VP's office. A giant cha=
lkboard with ice cream cones drawn alongside American flags served as the=
 backdrop for the podium.

The event was open press, so please refer to the transcript for quotes. B=
ut a general outline of the proceedings is below:

Sen. Sherrod Brown and Sec. Tom Perez took the stage at 2:30 p.m., with B=
rown addressing the crowd first and deeming the announcement of the Obama=
 administration's overtime rule as maybe "the single best day" of his lif=
e apart from the birth of his five grandchildren.

"Plain and simple, in the United States of America, when you work extra h=
ours, you should earn extra pay," he said.

Perez said he was pleased to unveil the new rule in "the heartland of Ame=
rica," while showering praise upon the founder and CEO of Jeni's ice crea=
m -- Jeni Britton Bauer -- for taking steps to provide her employees with=
 overtime pay prior to the administration addressing this issue.

He also pushed back against Republican opponents who say the new rule wou=
ld harm businesses.

"When you take care of your worker, you indeed fortify your bottom line,"=
 Perez said.

After concluding his own remarks, Perez introduced VP Biden at roughly 2:=
46 p.m. Biden was accompanied by Jeni herself, along with an employee who=
 goes by 'Tee' but is named TeeShanee Johnson. Jeni and TeeShanee spoke b=
riefly before Biden began his remarks, which ran about 20 minutes.

Again, please check the official transcript since it was open press. But =
he reflected on the importance of the middle class, recounting how his fa=
ther left Scranton because "there were no jobs, it was folding up."

And how Biden's father would tell him: "Joe, your job's about a lot more =
than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about self-respect. It's a=
bout your place in the community."

"You understand," Biden told the crowd. "I can see you nodding your hands=
. It's about your dignity. It matters. It's more than a paycheck."

"The vast majority of the American people, they're not looking for a hand=
out. They're just saying, 'Hey man, give me a shot," he added.

Noting that today's CEO makes 380 times the average employee, Biden said:=
 "So folks, we've got to right this ship. And this is a very important pi=
ece of doing it. Because millions of people are going to start to get pai=
d what they deserve."

Biden also recalled a conversation with President Xi of China, while the =
two were in Chengdu.

"He turned to me and he said, 'Can you define for me what America is?'" B=
iden said of the Xi. "And I said, I can do it in one word: It's about pos=
sibilities. Possibilities."

Following his speech, Biden did a local interview in a separate room whil=
e the pool held in place. The motorcade then rolled at 3:58 p.m. just dow=
n the street to North Market. More on that to come.
