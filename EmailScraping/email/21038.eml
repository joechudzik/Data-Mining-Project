So I looked at the space, and there's just nowhere to do a clutch.

You can say something like "this election season some folks have wanted to
max out in light of our opposition. The difference is mostly in name only,
though it also allows your name to be listed on the invitation along with
the hosts" or something like that.

between cohost and guest levels?

Jonathan,

I hope you are well. I want to personally invite you to our upcoming event
with President Obama  on the evening of June 8th. We will be advertising
this event more publicly in the coming days, but I wanted to make sure you
were among the first to know. Ken Lerer and Katherine Sailer are hosting
what promises to be an intimate evening with remarks from the President and
the chance to ask any questions you may have. We are expecting no more than
60 guests and each person will have the opportunity for a photo with the
President.

We=E2=80=99d love to see you there if you are available. I=E2=80=99ve inclu=
