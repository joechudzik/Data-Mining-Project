REMARKS BY PRESIDENT OBAMA

AFTER MEETING WITH VIETNAMESE CIVIL SOCIETY LEADERS

=A0

JW Marriott Hotel Hanoi

Hanoi, Vietnam

=A0

=A0

11:45 A.M. ICT

=A0

PRESIDENT OBAMA:=A0 I just had a wonderful conversation with some preemin=
ent civil society activists here in Vietnam.=A0 And I just want to thank =
them for taking the time to meet with me and discussing with me some of t=
he important work that they=92re doing, and the progress that=92s being m=
ade here in Vietnam.

=A0

We have a wide range of activists here.=A0 We have pastors whose congrega=
tions are doing important work helping individuals fight addiction and en=
couraging the faithful around the values of their faith.=A0 We have advoc=
ates on behalf of the disabled who are doing important work to make sure =
that they have full access to jobs and opportunity here in Vietnam.=A0 We=
 have LGBT activists who are making sure that the marginalized in society=
 have a voice.=A0 We have advocates on behalf of freedom of speech and pr=
ess and the Internet, who are doing important training throughout the cou=
ntry.=A0 We have a very popular artist here who is speaking out on behalf=
 of freedom of speech and expression and artists throughout Vietnam.

=A0

And so what I=92ve heard consistently from all of them is a recognition t=
hat Vietnam has made remarkable strides in many ways -- the economy is gr=
owing quickly, the Internet is booming, and there=92s a growing confidenc=
e here -- but that, as I indicated yesterday, there are still areas of si=
gnificant concern in terms of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, acc=
ountability with respect to government.

=A0

I emphasized in my meetings yesterday with the President, the Prime Minis=
ter, the General Secretary, the Chairwoman of the National Assembly that =
we respect the sovereignty and independence of Vietnam.=A0 Ultimately, it=
=92s up to the Vietnamese people to determine how their society functions=
 and the nature of the government.

But we do believe in certain universal values and it=92s important for us=
 to speak out on behalf of those values wherever we go.=A0 And it=92s par=
ticularly important and useful for me to hear directly from those who, un=
der often very difficult conditions, are willing to make their voices hea=
rd on behalf of greater freedom and human rights.

=A0

I should note that there were several other activists who were invited wh=
o were prevented from coming for various reasons.=A0 And I think it=92s a=
n indication of the fact that, although there has been some modest progre=
ss and it is our hope that through some of the legal reforms that are bei=
ng drafted and passed there will be more progress, there are still folks =
who find it very difficult to assemble and organize peacefully around iss=
ues that they care deeply about.=A0=20

=A0

And it=92s my hope that the government of Vietnam comes to recognize what=
 we=92ve recognized and what so many countries around the world have reco=
gnized, and that is that it=92s very hard to prosper in this modern econo=
my if you haven=92t fully unleashed the potential of your people.=A0 And =
your people=92s potential, in part, derives from their ability to express=
 themselves and express new ideas, to try to right wrongs that are taking=
 place in the society.=A0 And so it=92s my hope that, increasingly, the V=
ietnamese government, seeing the enormous strides that the country is mak=
ing, has more confidence that its people want to work together but also w=
ant to be able to assemble and participate in the society in ways that wi=
ll be good for everybody in the long run.

=A0

So, again, I want to thank all of you for your courageous work and I want=
 you to know that you will continue to have a friend in the United States=
 of America because we think the work that you=92re doing is work that=92=
s important everywhere -- including, by the way, in the United States, wh=
ere there are all sorts of activists and people who are mobilizing, often=
times are very critical of me, and don=92t always make my life comfortabl=
e but, ultimately, I think it=92s a better country and I do a better job =
as President because I=92m subject to that accountability.

=A0

Thank you so much.=A0 I very much appreciate it.=A0 Thank you, everybody.=
