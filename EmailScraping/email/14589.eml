Is there no way to legally avoid Donald Trump receiving sotto voce =
information about troop movements and plans that hinge on the plans of =
others and any other info even vaguely similar to such? I really do hope =
that he, in his own words, is soon regarded legally as a threat to this =
country=E2=80=99s life, health and safety. It now cannot be entirely =
left in the hands of the ignorant, even the most =E2=80=9Chelpful=E2=80=9D=
 of same, and especially the most hateful.=20

Isn=E2=80=99t there a way to string his own words together to clarify to =
the public that he is provably dangerous? Or are we just getting =
pay-back for marginalizing and looking down on a vast number of our =
neighbors for a big number of decades?

Obviating even the threat/possibility of a Trump presidency should =
happen before the November elections lest we all eat Thanksgiving crow =
instead of turkey.

Please find someone who can spearhead such immediately after the =
conventions if not sooner. I=E2=80=99m depending on you.
