After tensions explode in Nevada, it=92s time for Sanders to be honest with=
 his supporters
Washington Post
By Editorial Board<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-posts-view/>
May 18 at 7:04 PM


TENSIONS IN the Democratic presidential race exploded<https://www.washingto=
npost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/15/heres-what-happened-at-saturdays-drama=
tic-nevada-democratic-convention/> in Nevada over the weekend. Supporters o=
f Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) shouted, cursed and threw chairs<http://www.v=
ox.com/2016/5/17/11680904/bernie-sanders-nevada-convention> during a state =
party convention in which they failed to force rules changes they wanted. E=
ven though they were attempting to get more delegates than the caucus resul=
ts in the state suggested they deserved, they attacked the process as unfai=
r. The state party chair subsequently received death threats against her an=
d her family.

Mr. Sanders responded with self-righteousness and hypocrisy. He released a =
statement<https://berniesanders.com/press-release/statement-nevada/> in whi=
ch he listed a series of procedural complaints about the Nevada convention,=
 attacked the Democratic Party for not being inclusive enough and warned th=
at =93millions of Americans are outraged=94 and that =93the political world=
 is changing.=94 He offered a throwaway line, three paragraphs down, condem=
ning his supporters=92 hooliganism in a statement that mostly justified it.

Mr. Sanders=92s irresponsibility is sadly unsurprising. He has stirred up p=
opulist energy over the past several months with anti-corporate scapegoatin=
g and extravagant claims about policy. He has indulged and encouraged hyper=
bolic feelings that the country is badly adrift, that most of the nation ag=
rees with a left-wing agenda but is trapped in a corrupt system, and that n=
othing but a political revolution will do. He has attracted some big, passi=
onate crowds. But as he has lagged in votes, he increasingly has questioned=
 the legitimacy of the process and encouraged his supporters to feel disenf=
ranchised. The result is a toxic mix of unreason, revolutionary fervor and =
perceived grievance.

What is particularly galling about the Sanders camp=92s complaints of disen=
franchisement is that Mr. Sanders has benefited or tried to benefit from a =
variety of sketchy quirks of the nominating process. He has claimed support=
 for his cause in caucuses, which are quite exclusive, but he complains abo=
ut closed primary elections, which are more inclusive. In Nevada, his suppo=
rters were trying to game the rules to get more delegates and got upset whe=
n they did not succeed. As veteran Nevada politics reporter Jon Ralston put=
 it<https://www.ralstonreports.com/blog/sour-grapes-revolution-rocked-paris=
-hotel>, =93Despite their social media frothing and self-righteous screeds,=
 the facts reveal that the Sanders folks disregarded rules, then when shown=
 the truth, attacked organizers and party officials as tools of a conspirac=
y to defraud the senator of what was never rightfully his in the first plac=
e.=94

Mr. Sanders denies reality when he tells supporters he still has a plausibl=
e pathway to the Democratic presidential nomination. But passion cannot tru=
mp reality. It also cannot excuse violence, threats and attempts at mob rul=
e. It is past time for Mr. Sanders to be honest with his supporters, before=
 they take the campaign=92s irresponsible ethos to greater extremes and the=
reby help ensure the election of Donald Trump.
