Obama allies use Trump to press GOP on Supreme Court nominee
By DAVID PITT<http://bigstory.ap.org/content/david-pitt>
May. 9, 2016 2:30 PM EDT


DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) =97 Proponents of President Barack Obama's Supreme Co=
urt nominee believe they have a new winning argument to get the Republican-=
led Senate to act =97 the prospect of Donald Trump choosing someone to fill=
 the vacancy.

Hardly, says Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, the Iowa GOP sena=
tor who steadfastly opposes any confirmation hearings or votes on Judge Mer=
rick Garland until Americans elect the next president.

"There's no problem with Trump appointing people to the Supreme Court," sai=
d Grassley, who pointed to Trump's February GOP presidential debate promise=
 that he'd nominate conservative judges and specifically his mention of Wil=
liam Pryor.

President George W. Bush appointed Pryor, Alabama's former attorney general=
, to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Pryor has angered those on the=
 right and left, backing the ousting of Chief Justice Roy Moore over his fa=
ilure to remove a Ten Commandments monument and calling the Roe v. Wade dec=
ision legalizing abortion "the worst abomination in the history of constitu=
tional law."

"If he's going to appoint people like that I don't have any doubt," Grassle=
y said after a weeklong recess week back home in which liberal activist gro=
ups were relentless in pressuring the senator to hold hearings on Garland.

Grassley, who is seeking a seventh term, faced billboards and demonstration=
s as he met constituents at town halls around the state.

Obama nominated Garland on March 16 to fill the vacancy created by the deat=
h of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in February. While some Senate Rep=
ublicans have held courtesy visits with Garland, they refuse to hold hearin=
gs or vote on his nomination.

Outside of the Iowa Judicial Branch building in Des Moines a former Grassle=
y supporter said the longtime senator has lost his vote.

Ken Blackledge, 66, a produce farmer from Nevada in central Iowa and regist=
ered independent voter, said he has known Grassley for decades and voted fo=
r him because of the independent-minded Midwestern values he shared.

"I'm not voting for him anymore because he's not the Chuck that he was," Bl=
ackledge said. "He's more of a Washington Beltway-type person now which isn=
't the person I know."

Democrats and outside groups targeted Grassley because of his chairmanship =
of the Judiciary panel. Obama administration allies also have focused on vu=
lnerable Republican senators in states such as Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsyl=
vania and Wisconsin that Obama won twice.

Grassley said the strategy isn't working and he's doesn't feel any more thr=
eatened in this race than previous ones.

"I approach every election as if it's going to be the toughest election I'v=
e ever had and this one's no different," he said.

He did acknowledge that at nearly every stop on his weeklong tour of Iowa t=
own halls he was asked about the court.

Moveon.org<http://moveon.org>, a liberal political action group, said it is=
 buying a roadside billboard in Des Moines and plans Internet video and soc=
ial media campaigns against Grassley.

The day after Trump won in Indiana and became the likely GOP nominee, Ameri=
cans United for Change issued a statement. "It's official. Senator Grassley=
 is refusing to do his job because he wants Donald Trump =97 a racist, sexi=
st, misogynistic, nativist, isolationist, pathological liar ... to make the=
 next appointment to the Supreme Court," said Brad Woodhouse, the group's p=
resident.

The group organized mobile billboards featuring the "Tell your Senator: Do =
Your Job" theme, parking them at offices of senators running for re-electio=
n in nine swing states. In Iowa, a billboard was following Grassley to seve=
ral of his town halls.

Grassley hasn't faced a close election in decades. He won his Senate seat i=
n 1980 =97 the year Ronald Reagan became president =97 with 54 percent of t=
he vote.

"It's going to backfire. If there is one thing Iowans hate is a politicizin=
g of the courts and when you do it with millions in outside special interes=
t money it doesn't work," said Tim Albrecht, a political adviser hired this=
 week by the Republican Party of Iowa to help with the U.S. Senate campaign=
. Albrecht has worked on GOP campaigns since 1999 including the Mitt Romney=
 and Jeb Bush campaigns.

Grassley said refusing to consent to Obama's nominee is a legitimate use of=
 the Senate's advice and consent power provided in the Constitution.

Last week, Obama told CBS affiliate KCCI in Des Moines it's up to Grassley =
to defy Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., set aside politics a=
nd move Garland through the committee.

"Sen. Grassley wasn't elected by Sen. McConnell, he was elected by the peop=
le of Iowa," Obama said.
