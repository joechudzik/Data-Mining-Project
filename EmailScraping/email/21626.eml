Michel & Caroline,

Katherine and I would like to invite you to a dinner reception at our home =
for 50 friends on June 8th with President Obama. We are excited to hear fro=
m The President about the upcoming election and other critically important =
topics. The dinner is in support of The DNC and we are asking for a $10,000=
 contribution per person.

Our family hosted President Obama at one of his first fundraisers in New Yo=
rk City in 2007 and we couldn=92t be more pleased to be hosts again. I am s=
ure the President will return to NYC on behalf of the party's nominee in th=

as President on behalf of himself. I really hope you can be with us.
