Re: GOP=92s Effort to Undermine the Affordable Care Act Could Damage Their =
Own Chances in 2016
2016ers =96 be careful what you wish for.
For years, Republicans have tried everything in their power to dismantle th=
e Affordable Care Act, making it more difficult for Americans to obtain aff=
ordable health coverage and returning power to the insurance companies.

The Affordable Care Act has survived more than 50 GOP-led votes to repeal o=
r undermine it in the House alone, a presidential election, and a Supreme C=
ourt case already. It shouldn=92t surprise Republicans that voters don't wa=
nt to see people lose their health insurance<http://aufc.3cdn.net/04eeb9c2e=
40d6ba87e_w9m6bxp7g.pdf>. The uninsured rate is at or near historic lows<ht=
tp://www.gallup.com/poll/182348/uninsured-rate-dips-first-quarter.aspx>, an=
d health care spending is growing at the slowest rate ever recorded<http://=
www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/12/03/us-health-spending-grows-at-l=
owest-rate/19830573/>.
Lately, Republicans have been cheerleading another legal attack on the ACA:=
 the King v. Burwell case which could take affordable health coverage away =
from millions of Americans. But with so many Americans enjoying the benefit=
s of the ACA, the GOP effort to kill the law is starting to backfire and Re=
publicans are panicking.

Conservative columnist David Frum writes<http://www.theatlantic.com/politic=
s/archive/2015/04/the-question-that-will-decide-the-2016-election/391137/> =
that the question =93Will you take away my health insurance?=94 will decide=
 the 2016 elections.

We are confident that the Supreme Court will preserve access to affordable =
care for millions of Americans. But should the court rule in favor of King,=
 Republican 2016ers should expect to be subjected to the public=92s ire.
Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush would be dealt the undesirable task of defending t=
he court=92s decision in their home state of Florida. Florida is the state =
with the highest number of people at risk of losing subsidies for their ins=
urance in the nation. More than 1.3 million Florida residents would be hit =
with an average 359% premium increase. Good luck trying to spin that.
Governors Scott Walker, Chris Christie, and Bobby Jindal all opposed the Af=
fordable Care Act and chose to rely on the federal insurance exchange in th=
eir state. Yet none of them have laid out a contingency plan to deal with t=
he potential outcome of King v. Burwell and the loss of access to affordabl=
e health care for millions of their constituents.
Rand Paul is already in a difficult situation. Paul opposed the decision of=
 the Democratic governor of his home state of Kentucky to set up the highly=
-successful state-based health exchange that means Kentucky is not at risk =
of losing its subsidies, but as a supporter of the King lawsuit he thinks p=
eople in states without exchanges should stand to lose their subsidies. Wil=
l he admit he was wrong to oppose Gov. Beshear=92s actions to extend qualit=
y health care to Kentuckians?

And what do Florida, Ohio, Virginia, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Indiana =
have in common? They=92re more than just battleground states. They=92re sta=
tes where the Republican leadership refused to create a state-based exchang=
e, and whose residents would see average premium increases<http://www.washi=
ngtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/06/03/morning-plum-the-stakes-in-obam=
acare-lawsuit-just-got-a-whole-lot-higher/> as high as 359% if the court ru=
les in favor of King.

Ever since the law=92s inception, Republicans have based their entire polit=
ical strategy on attacking the Affordable Care Act =96 a law that prevents =
insurance companies from discriminating against people who have preexisting=
 conditions, allows young people to stay on their parents=92 health insuran=
ce, and closes the Medicare Part D doughnut hole for seniors, making prescr=
iption drugs more affordable. They have uniformly opposed a law that takes =
power away from the insurance companies and provides millions of Americans =
access to quality affordable health insurance.

Even a decision in favor of the American people won=92t put this issue to r=
est for Republican presidential contenders who have built their base suppor=
t on opposition to the ACA =96 and are running on a platform of repeal<http=
s://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/613810572719751168>. But in the unlikel=
y event that the Supreme Court grants the GOP fantasy of taking quality, af=
fordable health care away from millions of Americans, it couldn=92t come fo=
r them at a worse time.
