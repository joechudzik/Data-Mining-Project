Ideally, we would get her in early that morning (or the evening before if she prefers) and have her do a breakfast (or late morning) event potentially coupled with a few 1-on-1s thereafter.  We could get her out of Raleigh-Durham early afternoon (3/4 pm at the latest) and back to DC by that evening.  Let us know if that timeline is feasible; we can re-work!

Hi guys- sorry for the delay here. Tina has a personal obligation that we are trying to work through. What is the final timing on the event? We are trying to see if it possible for her to do something earlier in the day and be back in the evening.

Are you able to confirm May 27th for Tina.  Neera will not confirm until Tina confirms.

	Hey Sri, wanted to check in and see if you had a firmer grasp on Tina's schedule.  Our hosts are excited at the prospect of having her and we wanted to get them an update soon.  Thank you for your help on this and let us know if there is anything additional you need on our end.

	Sri, great news! Our co-hosts for the event, Diane Robertson and Anita Jackson, have confirmed that May 27th works well for both. They want to market the event to women and their daughters and they think it will have a big draw.
	
	Let us know if we are able to lock May 27th in on your end (they would like it to be a mid-day event, so we can get Tina in and out) and then we can get the logistics squared away. Thank you so much for working with us on this! We look forward to hearing from you.

	Hi Sri,
	
	Nice to be in touch again!  Let me know if you have any questions at all about these women's events.  We would especially love to confirm Tina for the event an Raleigh with Neera Tanden.  CAP has given us a few dates that work well for Neera to travel, so I'm happy to pass those along if that would help on your end.

	Hey Sri,
	
	Per our other chain, wanted to get this to the top of your inbox.  Also Cc'd here is my colleague, Claire Olszewski, who is our Women's Leadership Forum Director.  The two of us are working together on female empowerment roundtables (1-pager attached here) across the country and would love to get Tina onboard.
	
	Ideally, we would have Tina act as a (solo) surrogate in some cities and we would pair her with another surrogate (i.e. Neera Tanden, Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman, et al) in other cities, pending your approval of the pairing of course.  We have already made contact with Neera's office and the Congresswoman Coleman's staff; both have agreed to participate.
	
	If you wouldn't mind letting us know dates in May and June that work well for Tina, we can coordinate with our respective hosts and other surrogates to make sure everyone is in sync.  We can also get you the other surrogates availability if that's helpful.  My contact info is below if it's easier to talk through everything.  Thanks for all your help!

	Hi Sri,
	
	Jordan Vaughn here from the DNC.  Reaching out as I know Tina has spoken with both Michele Taylor and Jordan Kaplan about potentially doing female empowerment roundtables (1-pager attached) for us.
	
	Wanted to follow up with you to see if Tina has any open dates in May or June that would work for her to act as a surrogate at one of these roundtables.  The locations we are currently hoping to get her to are New York City and Raleigh-Durham.
	
	Please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have additional questions; my contact is below.  I look forward to hearing from you.
