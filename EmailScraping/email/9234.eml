Nevada Democrats: Sanders Campaign Has Violent Streak

Nevada's Democratic party<http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/democratic-p=
arty.htm> on Monday warned the Democratic National Committee<http://abcnews=
.go.com/topics/news/us/democratic-national-committee.htm> that Sen. Bernie =
Sanders' supporters have a penchant for violence and may seek to disrupt th=
e party's national convention in July, as they did during the Nevada conven=
tion Saturday.

The allegation is the latest fallout from a divisive Nevada Democratic conv=
ention that had to be shut down because security at the Paris Las Vegas hot=
el could no longer ensure order on Saturday night. The gathering closed wit=
h some Sanders supporters throwing chairs; later, some made death threats a=
gainst state party chairwoman Roberta Lange.

Sanders' backers had been protesting convention rules that ultimately led t=
o Hillary Clinton<http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/whitehouse/hillary-clin=
ton.htm> winning more pledged delegates. Clinton won the state's caucuses i=
n February, 53-47, but Sanders backers hoped to pick up extra delegates by =
packing county and state party gatherings.

Sanders had released a statement Friday night asking supporters to work "to=
gether respectfully and constructively" at the convention. But the state pa=
rty alleged in its letter to the co-chairs of the DNC Rules and By-laws com=
mittee, "The explosive situation arose in large part because a portion of t=
he community of Sanders delegates arrived at the Nevada Democratic State Co=
nvention believing itself to be a vanguard intent upon sparking a street-fi=
ght rather than attending an orderly political party process."

Michael Briggs, a Sanders campaign spokesman, said, "We do not condone viol=
ence or encourage violence or even threats of violence." He added that the =
campaign "had no role in encouraging the activity that the party is complai=
ning about. We have a First Amendment and respect the rights of the people =
to make their voices heard."

On Saturday, Sanders backers shouted down the keynote speaker, Sen. Barbara=
 Boxer, and others they thought were tilting the rules in Clinton's favor. =
Protesters shouted obscenities and rushed the dais to protest rulings. The =
letter by the state party's general counsel, Bradley S. Schrager, warns tha=
t similarly chaotic scenes could unfold in Philadelphia, site of the Democr=
atic National Committee's July convention.

"We believe, unfortunately, that the tactics and behavior on display here i=
n Nevada are harbingers of things to come as Democrats gather in Philadelph=
ia in July for our National Convention," Schrager wrote. "We write to alert=
 you to what we perceive as the Sanders campaign's penchant for extra-parli=
amentary behavior =97 indeed, actual violence =97 in place of democratic co=
nduct in a convention setting, and furthermore what we can only describe as=
 their encouragement of, and complicity in, a very dangerous atmosphere tha=
t ended in chaos and physical threats to fellow Democrats."

Several Sanders backers have condemned some of the threats against Lange an=
d other actions Saturday. Former state assemblywoman Lucy Flores, a current=
 congressional candidate, said in a statement: "There were actions over the=
 weekend and at the Democratic convention that very clearly crossed the lin=
e. Progressives need to speak out against those: Making threats against som=
eone's life, defacing private property, and hurling vulgar language at our =
female leaders."

State party offices remained closed Monday for security reasons after Sande=
rs supporters posted Lange's home and business addresses, email and cell ph=
one number online. Copies of angry and threatening texts to Lange were incl=
uded with the letter.

Lange said she'd been receiving hundreds of profanity-laced calls and texts=
 from inside and outside of the U.S., threatening her life and her family. =
Lange said the restaurant where she works has received so many calls it had=
 to unplug the phone.

"It is endless, and the longer it goes the worse it gets," Lange said in an=
 interview. "I feel threatened everywhere I go."

2 more flags. First, the Nevada Dems just blasted out the NYT story, with e=
xcerpts highlighting the threats that have been made against their Chairwom=
an.

Second, Politico just published their piece. They interview several state p=
arty leaders. See below.
Sanders Nevada revolt puts Democrats on notice<http://www.politico.com/stor=

ers-clinton-223243>

When hotel security kicked the raucous Nevada Democratic Party convention o=
ut of the facility on Saturday night, Hillary Clinton and Democratic leader=
s across the country were put on notice: Expect serious turbulence before a=
rriving in Philadelphia this summer.

For several chaotic hours, legions of Bernie Sanders=92 backers lashed out =
in anger and frustration over Clinton=92s delegate win there. The Paris Las=
 Vegas hotel finally managed to shut down the event, but another group of a=
ngry Sanders fans descended on the state Democratic headquarters the next m=
orning.

To the state party officials across the nation who saw videos from the conv=
ention on the Internet and on cable news Monday morning, the Nevada debacle=
 served as a jarring reminder that the party is still a long way from unite=
d after its long slog of a primary.

=93I think maybe Nevada is a little bit of a wake-up call=94 to party leade=
rs, warned West Virginia Democratic Vice Chairman Christopher Regan. "If ev=
ery state chair is not talking about how we can make sure that doesn't happ=
en in our state, [for] those that have yet to go, you're just not doing you=
r job."

In interviews with state Democratic chairs and other party leaders in rough=
ly a dozen states =97 some of whom back Sanders, and some who support Clint=
on =97 the consensus is that the Nevada meltdown was an anomaly. But many w=
orry that it might also be a harbinger of trouble at upcoming state convent=
ions, and perhaps even the July national convention in Philadelphia.

=93It is really important for [Sanders], if it=92s clear to him by the time=
 the convention starts =97 and that=92s likely to happen =97 [that Clinton =
has won], that he send messages to his supporters through his lieutenants, =
through the heads of his delegations, that if Secretary Clinton has the nec=
essary delegates, then we=92ll have a roll call,=94 said former Pennsylvani=
a governor and DNC chairman Ed Rendell, the convention chairman and a veter=
an Clinton ally, conceding that a fight over the party=92s platform would s=
till be likely.

Democrats had hoped to portray the party as a picture of unity =96 to contr=
ast to what=92s expected to be a messy, contentious Republican affair a wee=
k earlier in Cleveland =96 but those hopes are fading as some level of unre=
st is now expected in various state Democratic conventions in upcoming week=
s.

Those concerns began surfacing in formal and informal communications on Sun=
day and Monday, said state Democratic officials =97 and it is certain to be=
 a glaring topic of conversation later this week in Philadelphia when state=
 party leaders gather for their quarterly meeting.

=93You=92ll see similar things happen in other state conventions elsewhere =
in the next few weeks. I don=92t know if it will be to the same extent as N=
evada,=94 predicted Ken Martin, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer=
-Labor Party, noting that he had already discussed the Nevada proceedings d=
uring a meeting with his own party on Monday morning, weeks before their ow=
n convention. =93I can=92t imagine that tensions will be this high come lat=
e July [at the national convention]. But obviously if they are, that would =
be a problem."

Others express a higher degree of alarm, and hope to head off any further c=
lashes by encouraging the Vermont senator to call for a cool-down.

=93I hope Senator Sanders would understand that he is not only damaging his=
 own reputation and standing, but also doing harm to the Democratic Party, =
unless he encourages his supporters to be more genteel in their protest,=94=
 said Don Fowler, the Democratic National Committee chairman from 1995 to 1=
997.

In Nevada, Saturday=92s convention fell into disarray even after Sanders an=
d Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid =97 the state=92s leading Democrat =97 =
issued statements Friday urging a calm, respectful event following fraught =
county conventions last month.

The Vermont senator=92s backers at one point shouted down California Sen. B=
arbara Boxer, speaking on behalf of Clinton, while protesting party chairwo=
man Roberta Lange=92s stewardship of the event and accusing the local leade=
rship of stacking the rules and credentials against them when some delegate=
s =97 including those who were not registered Democrats =97 weren't accepte=
d.

Three hours after the event was scheduled to end, hotel security stepped in=
 to close out the proceedings but the turmoil didn=92t end there. Protestin=
g into the next day after Clinton came out on top, some angry participants =
posted Lange=92s phone number online, spurring thousands of death threats, =
according to the Nevada Democratic Party.

While many of the state Democratic conventions have gone off without a hitc=
h this year =97 both in states won by Clinton and by Sanders =97 the conten=
tiousness surrounding Nevada had some precedent.

In Colorado=92s April convention, Clinton-backing Sen. Michael Bennet was d=
rowned out by Sanders backers chanting =93change your vote,=94 referring to=
 his role as a super delegate. More recently in Maine, where Sanders won th=
e state=92s caucuses by a 2-1 margin but a majority of the state=92s 5 supe=
r delegates back Clinton, the Democratic convention approved a proposal for=
cing super delegates to proportionally align their support with the caucus =
results. Sanders supporters in the crowd booed and yelled =93sellout=94 and=
 =93go back to Massachusetts=94 at former Congressman Barney Frank, when he=
 called on them to unite behind Clinton.

State leaders said they can envision future gatherings getting even testier=
 as the race drags on and as Sanders keeps winning primaries, as he is expe=
cted to do on Tuesday.

"I am a little concerned about some of the procedural stuff, but I think we=
're prepared to have those conversations," said Wyoming Democratic Chairwom=
an Ana Cuprill, explaining that she had raised security concerns while plan=
ning the convention in her state, where Sanders won the popular vote but ti=
ed in the pledged delegate count.

To the Sanders team, such worries simply mean party officials should work o=
n finding a way to improve and clarify their procedures to be more inclusiv=
e toward supporters of a candidate who has won so many states and delegates=
.

=93We=92re still putting together the facts on what happened there at the t=
ime, but in general I can say that it would be in the Democratic Party=92s =
best interest for its leaders to figure out a way to welcome the millions o=
f people we have brought into Democratic Party politics this year, and make=
 them part of the process,=94 said Sanders=92 communications director Micha=
el Briggs. =93Smart, self-interested Democrats should figure out how to wel=
come those people rather than stiff-arm them."

"It=92s fair for [party leaders] to figure out what happened, and to try to=
 figure out a way to be more open and welcoming than the Nevada Democrats w=
ere for their own sake,=94 he added. =93Whoever is the nominee of this part=
y is going to need the support of as many people as possible, obviously, an=
d the way to do that is to take advantage of this boom in interest that has=
 happened because of Senator Sanders=92 message resonating all across the c=
ountry.=94

But most state leaders who spoke with POLITICO wouldn=92t commit to making =
changes, instead insisting, like Mississippi Democratic Chairman Rickey Col=
e, =93If you want to participate in the process, you have to know the rules=
."

Accordingly, those officials are now reviewing the plans for their own stat=
e conventions or gatherings =97 many spent Monday checking in with their st=
affs about their preparation. But they say they are more concerned about ho=
w Sanders=92 local fans read his campaign trail messaging, and fear that in=
sinuations that the nominating process is rigged =97 not to mention Sanders=
=92 consistent criticism of the party establishment =97 could lead to more =
unrest. They=92d prefer that the senator focus more of his campaign trail i=
re on Donald Trump.

South Carolina Democratic Chairman Jaime Harrison floated the idea of a pub=
lic event held in conjunction with Clinton, to send a message of party harm=
ony even if both candidates remain in the race for the foreseeable future.

In the meantime, in state after state, party leaders said they were aiming =
to ensure calm at their state conventions by explaining the rules and openi=
ng lines of communication between Clinton and Sanders supporters.

The alternative, said Texas Democratic Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa, is a Tru=
mp presidency: =93If people walk away just because they don=92t get their w=
ay, it will result in the worst president in the history of the United Stat=
es."

<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Nevada's <a href=3D"http://=
abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/democratic-party.htm" target=3D"_BLANK">
Democratic party</a> on Monday warned the <a href=3D"http://abcnews.go.com/=
topics/news/us/democratic-national-committee.htm" target=3D"_BLANK">
Democratic National Committee</a> that Sen. Bernie Sanders' supporters have=
 a penchant for violence and may seek to disrupt the party's national conve=
ntion in July, as they did during the Nevada convention Saturday.<o:p></o:p=
></span></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">The allegation is the lates=
t fallout from a divisive Nevada Democratic convention that had to be shut =
down because security at the Paris Las Vegas hotel could no longer ensure o=
rder on Saturday night. The gathering
 closed with some Sanders supporters throwing chairs; later, some made deat=
h threats against state party chairwoman Roberta Lange.<o:p></o:p></span></=
p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Sanders' backers had been p=
rotesting convention rules that ultimately led to
<a href=3D"http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/whitehouse/hillary-clinton.htm=
" target=3D"_BLANK">
Hillary Clinton</a> winning more pledged delegates. Clinton won the state's=
 caucuses in February, 53-47, but Sanders backers hoped to pick up extra de=
legates by packing county and state party gatherings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Sanders had released a stat=
ement Friday night asking supporters to work &quot;together respectfully an=
d constructively&quot; at the convention. But the state party alleged in it=
s letter to the co-chairs of the DNC Rules and
 By-laws committee, &quot;The explosive situation arose in large part becau=
se a portion of the community of Sanders delegates arrived at the Nevada De=
mocratic State Convention believing itself to be a vanguard intent upon spa=
rking a street-fight rather than attending
 an orderly political party process.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Michael Briggs, a Sanders c=
ampaign spokesman, said, &quot;We do not condone violence or encourage viol=
ence or even threats of violence.&quot; He added that the campaign &quot;ha=
d no role in encouraging the activity that the party
 is complaining about. We have a First Amendment and respect the rights of =
the people to make their voices heard.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">On Saturday, Sanders backer=
s shouted down the keynote speaker, Sen. Barbara Boxer, and others they tho=
ught were tilting the rules in Clinton's favor. Protesters shouted obscenit=
ies and rushed the dais to protest
 rulings. The letter by the state party's general counsel, Bradley S. Schra=
ger, warns that similarly chaotic scenes could unfold in Philadelphia, site=
 of the Democratic National Committee's July convention.<o:p></o:p></span><=
/p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&quot;We believe, unfortuna=
tely, that the tactics and behavior on display here in Nevada are harbinger=
s of things to come as Democrats gather in Philadelphia in July for our Nat=
ional Convention,&quot; Schrager wrote. &quot;We
 write to alert you to what we perceive as the Sanders campaign's penchant =
for extra-parliamentary behavior =97 indeed, actual violence =97 in place o=
f democratic conduct in a convention setting, and furthermore what we can o=
nly describe as their encouragement
 of, and complicity in, a very dangerous atmosphere that ended in chaos and=
 physical threats to fellow Democrats.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Several Sanders backers hav=
e condemned some of the threats against Lange and other actions Saturday. F=
ormer state assemblywoman Lucy Flores, a current congressional candidate, s=
aid in a statement: &quot;There were actions
 over the weekend and at the Democratic convention that very clearly crosse=
d the line. Progressives need to speak out against those: Making threats ag=
ainst someone's life, defacing private property, and hurling vulgar languag=
e at our female leaders.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">State party offices remaine=
d closed Monday for security reasons after Sanders supporters posted Lange'=
s home and business addresses, email and cell phone number online. Copies o=
f angry and threatening texts to Lange
 were included with the letter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Lange said she'd been recei=
ving hundreds of profanity-laced calls and texts from inside and outside of=
 the U.S., threatening her life and her family. Lange said the restaurant w=
here she works has received so many
 calls it had to unplug the phone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&quot;It is endless, and th=
e longer it goes the worse it gets,&quot; Lange said in an interview. &quot=
;I feel threatened everywhere I go.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">When hotel security kicked =
the raucous Nevada Democratic Party convention out of the facility on Satur=

ut on notice: Expect serious turbulence
 before arriving in Philadelphia this summer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">For several chaotic hours, =
legions of Bernie Sanders=92 backers lashed out in anger and frustration ov=
er Clinton=92s delegate win there. The Paris Las Vegas hotel finally manage=
d to shut down the event, but another
 group of angry Sanders fans descended on the state Democratic headquarters=
 the next morning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">To the state party official=
s across the nation who saw videos from the convention on the Internet and =
on cable news Monday morning, the Nevada debacle served as a jarring remind=
er that the party is still a long
 way from united after its long slog of a primary. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">=93I think maybe Nevada is =
a little bit of a wake-up call=94 to party leaders, warned West Virginia De=
mocratic Vice Chairman Christopher Regan. &quot;If every state chair is not=
 talking about how we can make sure that doesn't
 happen in our state, [for] those that have yet to go, you're just not doin=
g your job.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">In interviews with state De=
mocratic chairs and other party leaders in roughly a dozen states =97 some =
of whom back Sanders, and some who support Clinton =97 the consensus is tha=
t the Nevada meltdown was an anomaly.
 But many worry that it might also be a harbinger of trouble at upcoming st=
ate conventions, and perhaps even the July national convention in Philadelp=
hia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">=93It is really important f=
or [Sanders], if it=92s clear to him by the time the convention starts =97 =
and that=92s likely to happen =97 [that Clinton has won], that he send mess=
ages to his supporters through his lieutenants,
 through the heads of his delegations, that if Secretary Clinton has the ne=
cessary delegates, then we=92ll have a roll call,=94 said former Pennsylvan=
ia governor and DNC chairman Ed Rendell, the convention chairman and a vete=
ran Clinton ally, conceding that a fight
 over the party=92s platform would still be likely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Democrats had hoped to port=
ray the party as a picture of unity =96 to contrast to what=92s expected to=
 be a messy, contentious Republican affair a week earlier in Cleveland =96 =
but those hopes are fading as some level
 of unrest is now expected in various state Democratic conventions in upcom=
ing weeks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Those concerns began surfac=
ing in formal and informal communications on Sunday and Monday, said state =
Democratic officials =97 and it is certain to be a glaring topic of convers=
ation later this week in Philadelphia
 when state party leaders gather for their quarterly meeting.<o:p></o:p></s=

<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">=93You=92ll see similar thi=

 Party, noting that he had already discussed the Nevada proceedings during =
a meeting with his own party on Monday morning, weeks before their own conv=
ention. =93I can=92t imagine that tensions will be this high come late July=
 [at the national convention]. But obviously
 if they are, that would be a problem.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Others express a higher deg=
ree of alarm, and hope to head off any further clashes by encouraging the V=
ermont senator to call for a cool-down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">=93I hope Senator Sanders w=
ould understand that he is not only damaging his own reputation and standin=
g, but also doing harm to the Democratic Party, unless he encourages his su=
pporters to be more genteel in their
 protest,=94 said Don Fowler, the Democratic National Committee chairman fr=
om 1995 to 1997.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">In Nevada, Saturday=92s con=
vention fell into disarray even after Sanders and Senate Minority Leader Ha=

ging a calm, respectful event following fraught
 county conventions last month.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">The Vermont senator=92s bac=

<p><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black;background:white">Three hour=

While many of the state Democratic conventions have gone off without a hitc=

<p style=3D"background:white"><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">=
In Colorado=92s April convention, Clinton-backing Sen. Michael Bennet was d=

 his role as a super delegate. More recently
 in Maine, where Sanders won the state=92s caucuses by a 2-1 margin but a m=
ajority of the state=92s 5 super delegates back Clinton, the Democratic con=
vention approved a proposal forcing super delegates to proportionally align=
 their support with the caucus results.
 Sanders supporters in the crowd booed and yelled =93sellout=94 and =93go b=

on them to unite behind Clinton.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style=3D"background:white"><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">=
State leaders said they can envision future gatherings getting even testier=

&quot;I am a little concerned about some of the procedural stuff, but I thi=

<p style=3D"background:white"><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">=
To the Sanders team, such worries simply mean party officials should work o=

<p style=3D"background:white"><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">=
=93We=92re still putting together the facts on what happened there at the t=

 a way to welcome the millions of people we have brought into Democratic Pa=

<p style=3D"background:white"><span style=3D"font-size:10.5pt;color:black">=
&quot;It=92s fair for [party leaders] to figure out what happened, and to t=
