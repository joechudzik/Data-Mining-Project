Good morning! Its official: I've left CBS and officially started a media ag=
ency here in New York. The firm, 360bespoke, will handle PR/ marketing/ bra=
nding/ unique content creation and media strategies for a small collection =
of clients operating in the luxury and arts space: travel, fashion and beau=
ty, food, lifestyle, pursuits, and performers with international profiles. =
As many of you know those have been areas of great interest for me, whether=
 through Watch magazine, travel writing or my own journeys around the world=
. I hope to harness all that I've learned in 25 years in media to offer cli=
ents unique perspectives and strategies that come with that experience.

Though we (myself and colleagues) will open our doors this fall, we've alre=
ady signed up terrific clients, including: Dream, a luxury one of skin prod=
ucts started by London-based Deborah Mitchell; Cornelia, a global spa and w=
ellness brand; Waldan International, the rarest and most exclusive maker of=
 Swiss watches; Charlie Siem, the world famous 30-year-old violin virtuoso =
and also the face of Dior; up-and-coming Hollywood leading Dylan Bruce, an =
original cast member of "Orphan Black"; style icon Robert Konjic, who was d=
iscovered by Mario Testino and as Tom Ford's muse became the face of Gucci;=
 Alexi Tavel, whose company, Two of Wands, creates knit wear for discerning=
 clients around the world; and the non-profit Empowers Africa, a public cha=
rity that supports human empowerment, wildlife protection and land conserva=
tion in sub-Saharan Africa. I hope to announce a few more clients in the co=
ming week, and will send detailed information about all when we officially =
announce later this month.

It has been a whirlwind these past several weeks and I am very excited with=
 this new opportunity. If you know any young go-getters who want to get the=
ir feet wet working for a start-up, please send my way. And thank you for a=
ll your support during the last 10 years running CBS Watch magazine. I'm so=
 proud of what we created, and am excited to see where it goes next. They h=
ave a terrific team in place that will no doubt keep reaching for the stars=
 (figuratively and literally). Meanwhile, I can't wait to start this new ad=
venture.

Thanks so much,
Jeremy
