*Four New Insights Into Why Donald Trump Refuses To Release His Tax Returns=
*


Serious questions continue to be raised about why Donald Trump continues to
refuse to release his tax returns, a basic public disclosure made by every
Democratic and Republican presidential nominee for the past forty years.
Yesterday, the mandatory release of Trump=E2=80=99s personal financial disc=
losure
offered new insights into what Trump could be hiding
=E2=80=8B.

=E2=80=8B=E2=80=8B
Trump took 9/11 recovery funds, intended to help small businesses, and
spent them on his ritzy property at 40 Wall Street - just one example of
Trump using public funds for private gains.

=E2=80=9CDonald Trump made a pretty penny off a program to help small busin=
esses
hurt by 9/11, one of many times where The Donald took advantage of
government programs to save or make money off the taxpayer.


=E2=80=98Trump is a welfare king who owes much of his fortune to the larges=
se of
taxpayers,=E2=80=99 said Johnston.=E2=80=9D [NYDN, 5/18/2016
<http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-9-11-funds-program-n=
et-150g-payday-article-1.2641951>
=E2=80=8B]


=E2=80=8B=E2=80=8B
Trump will go to any length to avoid paying taxes =E2=80=93 at least 36 tim=
es, his
unpaid bills forced the state of New York to take him to court, and he
vastly undervalues his golf courses to local tax men.

=E2=80=9CAs recently as last week, Trump said he was =E2=80=9Cwilling to pa=
y more=E2=80=9D taxes
personally and that =E2=80=9Ctaxes for the rich will go up somewhat=E2=80=
=9D if he becomes
president. But the lawsuits and other tax-related disputes show a different
reality for his businesses. They illustrate a pattern of systematically
disputing tax bills, arguing for lower property assessments, and in some
cases not paying taxes until the government takes additional action.


=E2=80=9CAt least three dozen times, Trump companies=E2=80=99 unpaid tax bi=
lls have forced
the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance to go to local courts
to get liens against his properties to try to collect overdue bills. New
Jersey also had to go to court for a lien to collect a Trump company=E2=80=
=99s
unpaid tax bill.=E2=80=9D [USA Today, 5/19/2016
<http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/05/19/trumps-tax-troubles/84543538=
/>
]


=E2=80=9CWhen local governments try to tax Trump on his golf properties, he
incredulously turns out his pockets, often claiming that his courses are
worth far less than the estimates on his nomination filings.


=E2=80=9CTrump and his subsidiaries have employed this tactic with at least=
 six of
his U.S. courses, according to town and county officials in numerous
states. In at least one instance, the discrepancy between what Trump said a
course would sell for when claiming to the public he=E2=80=99s worth =E2=80=
=9CTEN BILLION
DOLLARS=E2=80=9D and what he told local officials come tax time was at leas=
t $48.6
million, or 97% less.=E2=80=9D [Fortune, 5/17/2016
<http://fortune.com/2016/05/17/donald-trump-golf-taxes-mar-a-lago-national-=
golf-day/>
]


=E2=80=8B
Trump may not be worth the $10 billion that he claims.


=E2=80=9CThe new disclosure comes amid swirling questions about Trump=E2=80=
=99s income and
net worth. This week, he reiterated his past claim that he was worth more
than $10 billion, although he has not provided independent evidence to back
up the claim.=E2=80=9D [Washington Post, 5/19/2016

=E2=80=8B
Trump is making a =E2=80=9Cflood of cash=E2=80=9D from running for presiden=

=E2=80=9CThe flood of cash highlights one of the most unusual aspects of Tr=
