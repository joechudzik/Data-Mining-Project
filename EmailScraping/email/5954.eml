Court Declines to Overturn North Carolina=92s Monster Voter Suppression Law=
: Groups to Appeal Decision

RALEIGH, NC =96 Today the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of No=
rth Carolina ruled that H.B. 589, a monster voter suppression law, does not=
 violate the Voting Rights Act or the Fourteenth, Fifteenth or Twenty-Sixth=
 Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The court chose instead to uphold a r=
estrictive and discriminatory measure, which has already significantly burd=
ened voters of color in the state. We intend to seek relief for provisions =
including the expansion of voter challenges, the elimination of same-day re=
gistration, the rollback of a week of early voting, a ban on the use of out=
 of precinct provisional ballots, the removal of a successful preregistrati=
on program for 16- and 17-year-olds and a restrictive photo ID requirement.=
 The current injunction on the law=92s proscriptions of same day registrati=
on and out of precinct voting =96 which has been in place since 2015, will =
remain in effect until June. Advancement Project, along with co-counsel fro=
m Kirkland & Ellis, LLP and attorneys Irving Joyner and Adam Stein, challen=
ged H.B. 589 on behalf of the North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP.=
 The groups will hold a media conference call on Tuesday, April 26 at 11:30=
 am EST to discuss the decision, and conference call details are forthcomin=
g. A partial statement is outlined below:

=93The continuation of H.B. 589=92s restrictive provisions is an affront to=
 democracy, and we intend to appeal the decision,=94 said the Rev. Dr. Will=
iam J. Barber II, president of the North Carolina State Conference of the N=
AACP and architect of the Forward Together Moral Movement. =93Through wides=
pread actions, rallies, marches and protests, we have said all along that w=
e would accept no less than unabridged access to the ballot for all eligibl=
e voters. Just like those who carried on before us, we will continue our mo=
vement challenging regressive and discriminatory voter suppression tactics =
on behalf of African Americans, Latinos, seniors, students and all those fo=
r whom democracy has been denied.=94

=93In abridging voting rights for African Americans and Latinos, H.B. 589 t=
urns back the clock to our nation=92s terrible Jim Crow past,=94 said Advan=
cement Project Co-Director Penda D. Hair. =93In a democracy, voting should =
be free, fair and accessible for all eligible voters. H.B. 589 tactically t=
argets the provisions that once made North Carolina among the states with t=
he highest turnout in the nation. This progress was especially clear among =
African-American and Latino voters, who came to rely on measures like early=
 voting, same-day registration and out of precinct provisional ballots to e=
nsure their voices were heard. By specifically targeting the very measures =
that were most used by people of color =96 in addition to imposing a restri=
ctive photo ID requirement =96 the legislature sought to disturb the levers=
 of power in North Carolina. This fight is not over. This is just one step =
in a legal battle that is going to continue in the courts to ensure that th=
e Voting Rights Act protects voters against discriminatory voting measures =
like H.B. 589.=94

=93The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals understood the ways in which H.B. 589 w=
ould impact voters of color in North Carolina, and previously enjoined port=
ions of this law,=94 said Advancement Project Senior Attorney Denise Lieber=
man. =93Now with even more evidence of the measure=92s discriminatory impac=
t on voters of color, we intend to once again take our case to the 4th Circ=
uit Court of Appeals.=94

=93North Carolina=92s suppressive voting law was exactly the type of regula=
tion that the Voting Rights Act was written to combat,=94 said Advancement =
Project Senior Attorney Donita Judge. =93Had this law been subjected to fed=
eral preclearance, it simply never could have passed. Now, countless voters=
, especially voters of color, are at risk of losing their voice in our elec=
tions. This is unacceptable in a democracy.=94
