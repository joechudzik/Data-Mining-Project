NEW 2016:

*         Fred Grimm: Billionaire sex offender from Palm Beach enjoys a spe=
cial kind of justice.  Prosecutors meted out a special kind of justice for =
Jeffrey Epstein, larded with fawning obsequiousness, secret dealings and an=
 astoundingly lenient sentence. After all, billionaires -- even billionaire=
 sex abusers -- aren't like you and me.

=20

Investigators documented that at least 34 underage girls, some as young as =
13, were repeatedly exploited by Epstein and his buddies for their carnal a=
musement at his Palm Beach mansion from 1999 to 2007. According to court do=
cuments, the girls were required to administer "topless or nude massage whi=
le Mr. Epstein masturbated himself." Occasionally, "the conduct escalated t=
o full sexual intercourse."

=20

State and federal prosecutors happily reduced what amounted to hundreds of =
federal and state sex crimes to two state charges -- soliciting prostitutio=
n and procuring a person younger than 18 for prostitution. Meanwhile, the f=
eds not only promised not to ring him up on federal charges, they granted i=
mmunity to his various co-conspirators.

=20

The federal prosecutors -- who seemed cowed by Epstein's high powered attor=
neys, including Roy Black, Kenneth Starr and Alan Dershowitz -- worked out =
the secret plea deal without bothering to inform victims that their abuser =
would be spared federal charges.

=20

The failure to notify the victims has been at the crux of a federal lawsuit=
 filed in West Palm Beach against the U.S. attorney's office in 2008 by two=
 of the young women, identified as Jane Doe No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2. On We=
dnesday, their attorneys filed a 57-page motion demanding a summary judgmen=
t in their favor.

=20

Whether or not, U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra grants the motion, the do=
cument (along with the scores of attachments containing nearly apologetic e=
mails and letters from prosecutors to Epstein's legal team) sure as hell pr=
ove that billionaires are treated with special deference in the U.S. justic=
e system.

=20

The correspondence shows prosecutors trying mightily to contrive a sweet pl=
ea deal that could be finalized before the victims or the media got wind of=
 it. One exchange suggested that he plead guilty in Miami, "which would hop=
efully cut the press coverage significantly."

=20

No wonder. Epstein received a piddling 18-month sentence for a crime that g=
ot less exalted sex offenders in Florida 10 or 15 years hard time. His less=
-than-hard-time amounted to 13 months in the Palm Beach County stockade. Ex=
cept he was allowed to spend 12 hours a day, six days a week at his nicely =
appointed office as part of a work-release program. He then served the bala=
nce of his sentence under house arrest -- quite an imposition for someone w=
ith a luxury mansion on the barrier island.

=20

Consider that this occurred at a time when low-rent sex offenders were forc=
ed to live like apocalyptic trolls beneath Miami's Julia Tuttle Causeway wi=
thout water, toilets, electricity.

=20

Of course, super rich Epstein, 62, managed to avoid such indignities. Nowad=
ays, the convict is occasionally featured in tabloid photos, snapped as he =
flits about New York in the company of young, beautiful women. Justice -- t=
he special justice for billionaires -- has been served.  [The Miami Herald =

*         JEFFREY EPSTEIN ATTORNEY ROY BLACK DENIES ALLEGATIONS IN LETTER B=
Y EX-U.S. ATTORNEY ALEXANDER ACOSTA

=20

Attorney Roy Black is disputing claims that he, and other attorneys represe=
nting Jeffrey Epstein, pried into federal prosecutors' personal lives in at=
tempting to disqualify them from investigating the billionaire sex offender=
.

=20

Black also denies Epstein's attorneys "negotiated in bad faith," while atte=
mpting to reach an agreement with federal prosecutors.

=20

In a written response Tuesday to the Palm Beach Daily News, Black disputes =
claims made against Epstein's defense team by former U.S. Attorney Alexande=
r Acosta. Those and other allegations by Acosta were contained in a three-p=
age letter printed Friday in the online publication The Daily Beast.

=20

Acosta was the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida at the ti=
me Epstein was being investigated on federal charges related to multiple se=
x crimes with minor girls. Black, the Miami attorney who successfully defen=
ded William Kennedy Smith against rape charges, was part of Epstein's legal=
 dream team.

=20

Epstein was never charged with a federal crime. He and his attorneys struck=
 a deal with federal prosecutors, which was outlined in a non-prosecution a=
greement. According to the agreement, Epstein had to plead guilty to two st=
ate charges, register as a lifelong sex offender and serve 18 months in jai=
l. If he successfully completed those terms and served one-year of probatio=
n, then Epstein would not be prosecuted on federal charges as they related =
to approximately 30 to 40 victims.

=20

In a written response to the Daily News, Black said, "We did present argume=
nt after argument why a proposed federal prosecution against Mr. Epstein wa=
s unsupported by the evidence. We detailed the so-called evidence during ma=
ny meetings with prosecutors and agents.

=20

"We were quite candid in disclosing all the evidence we had gathered in our=
 investigation and I believe we made a convincing case why charges were not=
 appropriate. I still believe that today."

=20

According to Acosta, now dean of the Florida International University Colle=
ge of Law, federal prosecutors and agents met with Black in the summer of 2=
007. The prosecutors presented Epstein a choice: plead guilty to state felo=
ny charges resulting in two years imprisonment, registration as a sex offen=
der and restitution for the victims or prepare for a federal felony trial.

=20

What followed, Acosta said, was that Epstein's defense team launched "a yea=
rlong assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors.

=20

"I use the word assault intentionally, as the defense in this case was more=
 aggressive than any which I, or the prosecutors in my office, had previous=
ly encountered," Acosta said in his letter.

=20

Among the "legal superstars" on Epstein's defense team: Harvard professor A=
lan Dershowitz, Kenneth Starr, Jay Lefkowitz and several others, including =
prosecutors who had formally worked in the U.S. Attorney's Office and in th=
e Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section of the Justice Department.

=20

Acosta said that one member of the defense team warned him "the office's ex=
cess zeal in forcing a good man to serve time in jail might be the subject =
of a book if we continued to proceed with this matter."

=20

Black said he's never heard anyone mention writing a book about the Epstein=
 case. "Mr. Acosta claims we negotiated in bad faith by appealing to the De=
partment of Justice in Washington," Black said. "Any person under investiga=
tion by a United States attorney, meaning any of the 94 such offices in the=
 country, has the right to seek review by the Department of Justice and it =
is so provided for in their manual. Thus I cannot imagine invoking this rig=
ht could be construed as bad faith.

=20

"In our system of justice, people are given the right of appeal and there s=
hould be no implication of wrong doing by exercising it.

=20

"Finally Mr. Acosta mentions we looked for personal peccadilloes of prosecu=
tors," Black said. "I am not sure what he refers to but this never happened=
. We did point out misconduct and over-reaching by certain people involved =
in the investigation. Not only is there nothing wrong with this but it is a=
 necessary part of the process. There will always be people who abuse the g=
reat power of the government and we can not stand by silently when it occur=
s."

The non-prosecution agreement was sealed in Epstein's state felony file unt=

=20

Murphy, the Democratic congressional candidate hoping to unseat U.S. Rep. A=

slated for tomorrow night in Coral Gables.

=20

The event is being held at the home of Roy Black, the famed criminal attorn=

l also get to rub shoulders with a genuine celebrity: Black's wife, Lea, wh=

*         LET'S GET DRUNK: ROY BLACK, POLO BOSS JOHN GOODMAN'S LAWYER; HOST=
S YEARLY SHINDIG

=20

"International Polo Club Palm Beach founder John Goodman, whose alleged kil=
ling of a 23-year-old man in a car crash last month is still under investig=
ation, was nowhere to be found among those who paid homage to high-profile =
South Florida attorney Roy Black.

=20

Funny thing, because when it comes to celebrities attending The Blacks' Ann=
ual Gala in Miami Beach Saturday night, Black and his wife Lea can always c=
ount on those he extracted from the criminal justice system. And yes, there=
 may be some of future clients of Black's there, too.

=20

Girls Gone Wild's Joe Francis was one of them. He once had tax and public m=
orals problems, but Black made it all better. So he came to the Fontaineble=
au Miami Beach for the big party.

=20

"He wins every case," Francis said. "His approach is different from other l=
awyers, partly because he never worked for the government as a prosecutor. =
He believes in your case 100 percent, and I don't know any other who does t=
hat."

=20

Three-time Indianapolis and Dancing With The Stars winner Helio Castroneves=
 showed up. Black got him out of his little tax evasion issue last year.

=20

Yet John Goodman, who could soon be facing DUI and manslaughter accusations=
 but hasn't been charged, was MIA.

=20

And who could blame him?

=20

Roy Black, after all, kicked off the open bar, three-course fiesta with thi=
s announcement to the 1,000-plus guests who'd paid up to $1,000 each: "If y=
ou guys don't get drunk and dance on the tables, then this party has failed=
!"

=20

The Blacks party, which could rival most Palm Beach shindigs in the wealth =
and notoriety of participants,  has long been a staple of Miami's social li=
fe. And it raises millions for educational charities.

=20

It gathers usually well-known figures from all facets of life.

=20

The legal community, for example, was represented with the likes of Harvard=
 prof Alan Dershowitz, who represented Palm Beach millionaire perv Jeffrey =
Epstein with Black; O.J. Simpson prosecutor Marcia Clark, unrecognizable af=
ter years of plastic surgery; and Jim Ferrara, a successful local litigatio=
n attorney.

=20

Also there: rapper Rick Ross; shoe designer Lisa Pliner; TV chefs Ron Dupra=
t and Bobby Flay; The Real Housewives of Atlanta's Kim Zolciak;  poker star=
 Noah Schwartz; Bob Seger saxophonist Alto Reed; Gov. Charlie Crist and his=
 lovely bride, Carole Crist; singers Natalie Cole, Paulina Rubio and Gloria=
 Estefan; boxer Lennox Lewis; former Miami Heat star Alonzo Mourning; Girls=
 Gone Wild's Joe Francis; and others. (See them all by clicking here or on =
the photos)

=20

Gov. Charlie Crist, who's running for U.S. Senate, was received like a rock=
 star. Despite the polls showing he's behind Marco Rubio among Republicans,=
 Crist pressed the flesh with a vengeance and showed he's still popular amo=
ng the beautiful people.

=20

And despite stories saying that his wife of a little more than a year is no=
where to be found, the First Lady was glued to her husband.

=20

"He's a brilliant attorney who has extraordinary admiration of a lot of peo=
ple," the governor said of Black. "He's a hard worker, and those usually ge=
t lucky."

=20

Well, there was one failure that night: the Blacks couldn't auction off a B=
ugatti Veyron, the world's most expensive car. But then, who in this econom=
y could get someone to bid $2.75 million on anything?
