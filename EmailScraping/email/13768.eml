The =91Never Trump=92 movement had the Worst Week in Washington<https://www=
.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/23/the-never-trump-movement-had=
-the-worst-week-in-washington/>

By Chris Cillizza

Remember Wisconsin? That state's primary on April 5 was the beginning of th=
e end for Donald Trump, insisted the " Never Trump" movement within the GOP=
. The gig was up! Voters were on to him! He was imploding!

Fourteen days later, Trump took more than 60 percent of the vote and all bu=
t a handful of the available 95 delegates in New York's primary. Trump's ac=
ross-the-board win zeroed out Ted Cruz's mathematical chances of getting to=
 the 1,237 delegate threshold before the July national party convention. Me=
aning that Trump is now the only one of the three Republican candidates sti=
ll in the race who can secure a majority of the delegates on the first ball=
ot.
The calendar will only get better for Trump. He could well sweep all five s=
tates -- Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island -- =
that vote on Tuesday, further adding to his momentum. And anew poll release=
d Friday showed Trump leading Cruz in Indiana's May 3 primary, a state wher=
e the "Never Trump" forces have already dedicated lots of time and money an=
d the winner can take most or all of the state's crucial 57 delegates.

Amid this series of wins, Trump has also taken genuine strides to improving=
 his campaign staff -- and his new hires have, in turn, begun much-needed o=
utreach efforts to GOP delegates and establishment types to assure them tha=
t Trump doesn't present nearly the risk as the party's nominee as some have=
 suggested. The new team also appears to have Trump's ear, as the GOP front=
-runner delivered a much more measured victory speech than usual following =
his New York win.

What's an organization driven by the sole purpose of keeping Trump from the=
 nomination to do? Struggle, that's what.

A movement like "Never Trump" is entirely dependent on momentum and the mon=
ey that goes along with it. Allowing Trump to roll through April almost unc=
ontested -- no part of the "Never Trump" group spent any money on TV in New=
 York -- looks like a major strategic mistake in retrospect.
John Weaver, chief strategist for John Kasich's presidential campaign,bashe=
d the "Never Trump" movement for its absence from the playing field in two =
major states.

Trump may not ultimately get to 1,237 delegates. And he may well never end =
up as the Republican presidential nominee. But, he had a VERY good week. An=
d, that means those trying to keep him from the nomination had a bad week. =
In fact, the Worst Week in Washington.
