Hi all =97 A few emails from the President to send on the 31st for our May =
deadline. Let me know if you have any flags, and thanks!

Sender: Barack Obama

Friend =97

I=92m going to be sticking around Washington, D.C. for a little longer once=
 my time in the White House comes to an end, and one of the things I=92m re=
ally looking forward to is the number of new voices that will be coming to =
this city when Democrats take back the Senate in November.

We all know how important it is to elect a Democratic President who can bui=
ld on the foundation we laid together over the past seven and a half years,=
 and who won=92t allow the progress we=92ve made to be rolled back. But we=
=92ve also got to have a Senate that can BE A partner in the process.

There=92s still so much work to do. For as far as we=92ve come, there are s=
till too many people who have a tough time getting a job, or making sure th=
eir kids can get the kind of education they deserve. The ability of women t=
o determine their own health care decisions is threatened all across the co=
untry. Economic inequality has continued even as we have dramatically impro=
ved and stabilized the economy.

It=92s going to take new energy and ideas coming not only from the Oval Off=
ice, but also from a Senate full of leaders who are committed to rolling up=
 their sleeves and getting to work. Folks like Katie McGinty in Pennsylvani=
a, Ted Strickland in Ohio, Tammy Duckworth in Illinois, and Russ Feingold i=
n Wisconsin. These are just some of the great Democrats we have running acr=
oss the country and chances we have to pick up key seats and win back the S=
enate. But it=92s going to take all of us digging a little deeper and doing=
 what we can to cross that finish line on November 8th.

Can I count on you to pitch in $10 or whatever you can before our end-of-mo=
nth deadline at midnight to help us get there?

Thanks for being part of this, NAME. We can=92t do it without you.

Friend --

In America, it has always been and remains the duty of each generation to h=
elp close the gap between our ideals and the reality of the time, and to ma=
ke our country better off for those to come. From our founding fathers who =
declared our independence to those who gave their lives in the fight to end=
 slavery, from the women who marched for their right to vote to the movemen=
t that grew out of Stonewall to demand equality for the LGBT community, thi=
s ideal has defined who we are as Americans.

I=92m proud to say that we=92ve made some real strides over these past seve=
n and a half years -- but the journey continues. LGBT Americans now have th=
e right to marry whom they love and serve our country openly in the Armed F=
orces, yet still face systematic, legal forms of discrimination in certain =
states today. Women have made great strides forward in the workplace, but a=
re still not guaranteed the equal pay they deserve.

We=92ve come far, but we still have work to do before we can consider the e=
quality gap closed =97 that=92s why I=92m asking you to support Democrats w=
ho will keep us moving forward together.

LINKS

I promise you that I'll always keep fighting, NAME, and I know that you wil=
l too. But in order to protect our progress and keep making advances, we ne=
ed leaders in the White House and Congress who will work for all of the peo=
ple, with no exceptions. That means we need Democrats.

So, if you can, pitch in $10 or more before the deadline at midnight tonigh=
t to help Democrats win big up and down the ballot on Election Day:

Thanks for doing this today, NAME.

Friend --

When I look back over the past seven years, so much of what we fought for w=
e did because it was common sense.

Facing the threat of climate change, it made sense to take major strides to=
 combat it, even while some refused to accept the scientific fact that it e=
xists. With millions of Americans having to choose between paying their med=
ical bills or putting a roof over their heads, it seemed clear that we need=
ed to make affordable health care available to every person in this country=
. When we saw our hardworking neighbors struggling to get by, doing what we=
 could to raise the minimum wage and make paychecks more fair just made sen=
se.

But what I have come to discover as I=92ve watched this election unfold is =
that that kind of common sense isn=92t all that common when it comes to the=
 folks running in this election on the other side of the aisle -- because a=
ll of these things that we knew were the right things to do, they want undo=
ne.

So if we want to protect everything we=92ve done, and keep building on this=
 foundation, then it=92s also common sense that we have to elect democrats =
who will do just that. And with our end-of-May deadline at midnight, I=92m =
hoping you=92ll pitch in $10 or more today to help:
