DNC Chair Statement on Today's Primaries



WASHINGTON - DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following s=
tatement on today's primaries in Kentucky and Oregon:



"With two more Democratic primary contests closed tonight in Kentucky and O=
regon, it's once again clear that our voters are excited and enthusiastic a=
bout the future of our party, about building on the last seven years of pro=
gress, and ready to hold Donald Trump accountable for the damage he's done =
as a candidate and the damage he's promising he would do as president.



"In just the last week, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, h=
as backpedaled away from his own pledge to release his tax returns, vowed t=
o slash taxes for those at the top like himself, faced questions about pret=
ending to be his own publicist, refused to address his well-documented hist=
ory of misogyny, insulted one of our country's most important allies, and h=
is campaign called their selection of a white supremacist delegate a 'datab=
ase error.' Every day it seems, the American people are discovering a new e=
xample of his recklessness, lack of judgment and unstable temperament.  Tha=
t's why Democrats will head into the general election energized, understand=
ing what's at stake and championing the values and priorities that match th=
ose of the American people. As we move closer to our convention and the gen=
eral election, it's clearer than ever we must elect a Democrat as our 45th =
president."
