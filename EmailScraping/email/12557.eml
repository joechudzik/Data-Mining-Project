Patrice was supposed to send it to us once she received it, but that didn't=
 happen. Stewart is right here.

the party's national convention in July, as they did during the Nevada conv=

>=20

nvention that had to be shut down because security at the Paris Las Vegas h=
otel could no longer ensure order on Saturday night. The gathering closed w=
ith some Sanders supporters throwing chairs; later, some made death threats=
 against state party chairwoman Roberta Lange.
>=20

 to Hillary Clinton<http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/whitehouse/hillary-cl=

 in February, 53-47, but Sanders backers hoped to pick up extra delegates b=
y packing county and state party gatherings.
>=20
> Sanders had released a statement Friday night asking supporters to work "=
together respectfully and constructively" at the convention. But the state =
party alleged in its letter to the co-chairs of the DNC Rules and By-laws c=
ommittee, "The explosive situation arose in large part because a portion of=
 the community of Sanders delegates arrived at the Nevada Democratic State =
Convention believing itself to be a vanguard intent upon sparking a street-=
fight rather than attending an orderly political party process."
>=20

olence or encourage violence or even threats of violence." He added that th=
e campaign "had no role in encouraging the activity that the party is compl=
aining about. We have a First Amendment and respect the rights of the peopl=
e to make their voices heard."
>=20
> On Saturday, Sanders backers shouted down the keynote speaker, Sen. Barba=
ra Boxer, and others they thought were tilting the rules in Clinton's favor=
. Protesters shouted obscenities and rushed the dais to protest rulings. Th=

hat similarly chaotic scenes could unfold in Philadelphia, site of the Demo=
cratic National Committee's July convention.
>=20

 in Nevada are harbingers of things to come as Democrats gather in Philadel=
phia in July for our National Convention," Schrager wrote. "We write to ale=
rt you to what we perceive as the Sanders campaign's penchant for extra-par=
liamentary behavior =97 indeed, actual violence =97 in place of democratic =
conduct in a convention setting, and furthermore what we can only describe =
as their encouragement of, and complicity in, a very dangerous atmosphere t=
hat ended in chaos and physical threats to fellow Democrats."
>=20

and other actions Saturday. Former state assemblywoman Lucy Flores, a curre=
