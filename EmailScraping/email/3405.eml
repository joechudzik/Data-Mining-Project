By Mike Allen (@mikeallen; mallen@politico.com) and Daniel Lippman (@dlippman; dlippman@politico.com)

Good Wednesday morning. Donald Trump said last night after winning each of the five Acela Primary states by 29 or more points: "As far as I am concerned, it's over. ... I consider myself the presumptive nominee - absolutely." He's right about both. To the pundits who'll try to infuse next week's Indiana primary - Ted Cruz's last stand -- with melodrama and cosmic significance: Good luck. Trump won Connecticut by 29, Delaware by 40, Maryland by 31, Pennsylvania by 35, Rhode Island by 39. I think the voters are trying to tell us something. 

--A top Republican insider laments that even with conservative calculations, he now projects Trump will cross the magic number of 1,237 delegates to win on the first ballot at the Cleveland convention: "The dominoes are falling, and you can't stop them. ... Kasich staying in the race was an in-kind contribution to Trump. It blocked Cruz from ever getting his one-on-one shot."

--OLD TRUMP was back for last night's victory speech (gloating, off the cuff), and Corey Lewandowski was more prominent than Paul Manafort in the camera shot. Trump will have a teleprompter for today's foreign-policy speech at noon in D.C. A speechwriter supplied a text, but MSNBC reports that Trump "rewrote it."

--Kevin Madden tells us that for two months, the Trump wave has divided establishment Republicans into two camps: RESIGNATION and RESISTANCE camps - and RESIGNATION is winning. Madden says the too-little, too-late Never Trump movement "only changed the atmospherics, never the fundamentals." He said it became "pure fantasy" to think you could derail Trump with the momentum he was picking up, going back to at least Nevada on Feb. 23.

--Daniel says that of 39 states that have voted (including D.C.), Trump has won 26. Cruz carried 10 (Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, Wyoming), Rubio snared two (D.C. and Minnesota) and Kasich took Ohio.

--Cruz has gotten less than 25% of the vote in 20 states (including D.C.).

MIKE MURPHY, who headed the lavishly funded pro-Jeb super PAC, to Brian Williams, co-anchoring MSNBC's coverage with Rachel Maddow: "The lights are going out across the Republican Party tonight. ... It's like Trump has built a lab to blow a general election, even against Hillary Clinton."

--Murphy predicted Trump will "turn on the insult comedy" against Clinton: "But her big judo win is to play the victim. ... Jeb was the anti-Trump; now we have Trump. ... And Kasich, the guy who COULD win a general election, can't get arrested."
 
TRUMP phoner with "Morning Joe" this morning: "I don't even know if it's going to be Hillary. ... I don't know what's happening with the email scandal. ... People that did far less are sitting in jail cells." On his campaign HQ in Trump Tower: "The day the campaign ends, I get the highest rents in the city." On the camps in his campaign: "Paul actually gets along very well with Corey. They have different functions ... very separate functions."

 HILLARY CLINTON, after winning four of five states last night (all but Rhode Island): "Now, the other day, Mr. Trump accused me of playing the 'woman card.' (JEERING) Well, if fighting for women's health care, and paid family leave, and equal pay is playing the 'woman card,' then deal me in."

TOP TWEETS: Cook Political Report's Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict): "Trump carried every single county and congressional district that voted today" ... Democratic pollster Matt McDermott (@mattmfm): "Kasich lost Greenwich to Trump. Greenwich, folks!" By 7 points:  http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=72e10148705be6688bd3349ded0ed08b617f9bb95bc331ced64f0fb84dc62990 ... @mattyglesias: "Primary night web traffic isn't what it used to be. Clearest sign that these nominations are settled" ... @HolmesJosh: "Mary Pat [at Trump victory speech] one-ups Christie in the back drop with her best Adele: 'Hello...it's me.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=72e10148705be668d970db12276b7536a5704cdc48f238c6f001c55b8b6e2cbf

GLENN THRUSH, "Five takeaways from Tuesday's primaries": "Trump's campaign is in turmoil, oh, and he's groping for a grown-up message. ... Yet the Tangerine Tornado keeps winning and winning, by huger and huger margins - shattering the Never-Trump army and making mockery of the shotgun marriage between chastened foes Ted Cruz and John Kasich. ... He consolidated the GOP base behind him with a succession of slam-dunk wins that will make it hard for his opponents to argue he's not the party's legit choice." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=72e10148705be668a0dd999758943c1b3e4a7e4f626a76f797d26961adf85c10 

--"Trump passes Romney's popular vote total, likely to break GOP record," by Kyle Cheney: "Trump surged to 9.9 million votes ... That's already more than 100,000 more than Romney earned in the entire 2012 primary season [or] John McCain earned in 2008. ... [H]e's positioned to easily pass the modern record-holder George W. Bush - who collected 10.8 million votes in 2000. ... [A]nti-Trump forces [are] attempting to thwart the candidate who is likely to win more Republican primary votes than any GOP contender in at least the last 36 years, and maybe ever." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=72e10148705be66896f9c332d0152826cf5cdbba11f494860ec60d5983e4ade2 

DRUDGE BANNER is Cruz, looking heavenward, "ELIMINATED" -- with "TED" in red -- linking to the Tea Party site Gateway Pundit, "IT'S OFFICIAL=> Ted Cruz Is Mathematically ELIMINATED from GOP Race - With Chart." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=72e10148705be668d06ee6de81ad102896b9d2bc144190a3e0c2187e89a12c1a

HUFFPOST BANNER: "EAST MODE: TRUMP 5-STATE SWEEP... DEL TRACKER: 110 Trump, 5 Kasich, 3 Cruz."

NEARING CLINCH ... Upshot's Nate Cohn on N.Y. Times p. A16, "Why Donald Trump Is Probably Two States From Victory": "He has long been favored in the polls in two of the remaining primary states, New Jersey and West Virginia. That leaves Indiana and California as the crucial prizes that would put Mr. Trump over the top - and while he was once thought to be vulnerable in both states, polls have shown him with a modest lead." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=72e10148705be668e0ee08bb75905dee148af9f7911d78632dc465644cfa3706

CHUCK TODD on "Morning Joe," on the Cruz-Kasich alliance: "It would have been a great idea six weeks ago."

JON KARL, on Monday's "Good Morning America," reported "an increasing sense of desperation" in the Cruz campaign: "I would not be surprised to see him name a running mate even before the Indiana primary next week," most likely Carly Fiorina.

TRUMP SPEAKS in D.C. at noon today on foreign policy. The original location was the National Press Club, but an advisory yesterday said: "Due to the overwhelming interest in Mr. Trump's Foreign Policy speech the venue has been changed to the Mayflower Hotel." 

Then at 6 p.m., he'll rally thousands at the Indiana State Fairgrounds with basketball coaching legend Bobby Knight.

--AP's Jill Colvin says the speech "will focus on ... trade, the global economy and national security. ... Trump has a lot to prove when it comes to calming foreign leaders and policy professionals. They've been stunned by his often brash policy proclamations." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=72e10148705be668664f4e3ce327d0e3fd3f5cdc3ab76b082505d8e126d59340

CONTINENTAL DIVIDE -- WashPost A1, Phil Rucker and Jose DelReal: "Tuesday's results brought into sharp relief the regional divide in the Republican race. Trump has dominated east of the Mississippi River, winning every contest - from New England to the Bible Belt, save for three: Maine, Ohio and Wisconsin. ... Cruz's strength has been concentrated in the Plains, Midwest and Rocky Mountain West, where many contests have been caucuses that attract fewer voters than primaries and reward the best-organized campaigns." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=72e10148705be668d32531f83f7a364062c87579a4cfa38d363ddbca27795af6

Sanders won a majority of men and drew the support of younger voters." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=72e10148705be66863edcccc4cacc805a012ddd71d9d448f240ca66dc5670545

ARIANNA HUFFINGTON joins Uber's board: CEO "Travis [Kalanick] loves her for her entrepreneurial spirit, her high EQ and her storytelling ability. They will be on [CNBC] Squawk Box together during the 8:00 hour and both will attend the WHCD at the weekend." Travis posts on Uber's blog: "Arianna knows a thing or two about being an entrepreneur. ... From the start of our friendship it was obvious that she believes deeply in our mission: transportation as reliable as running water, everywhere for everyone. At a staff event last fall, Arianna told the crowd how she once used Uber to conjure a little magic of her own. ... 

"That ability to tell stories is invaluable for an engineer like me, whose natural tendency is to rely on data. As I've discovered, that doesn't always work perfectly. So it's Arianna's emotional intelligence that I am most excited about learning from. She is one of the few people who begins every conversation by asking how you are, not how your business is doing." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=72e10148705be668fa0e72ed5d615e0387c7d5563151e4c238886508223d4697 ... 1-min. video http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=72e10148705be66862b9a3edf1be1e17fc0caf21bbafe7a6d87e6a6a39db228f

</b>Donald Trump said last night after winning each of the five Acela Primary states by 29 or more points: &quot;As far as I am concerned, it's over. ... I consider myself the presumptive nominee - absolutely.&quot; He's right about both. To the pundits who'll try to infuse next week's Indiana primary - Ted Cruz's last stand -- with melodrama and cosmic significance: Good luck. Trump won Connecticut by 29, Delaware by 40, Maryland by 31, Pennsylvania by 35, Rhode Island by 39. I think the voters are trying to tell us something. </p><p><b>--A top Republican insider
</b> laments that even with conservative calculations, he now projects Trump will cross the magic number of 1,237 delegates to win on the first ballot at the Cleveland convention: &quot;The dominoes are falling, and you can't stop them. ... Kasich staying in the race was an in-kind contribution to Trump. It blocked Cruz from ever getting his one-on-one shot.&quot;</p><p><b>--OLD TRUMP</b> was back for last night's victory speech (gloating, off the cuff), and Corey Lewandowski was more prominent than Paul Manafort in the camera shot. Trump will have a teleprompter for today's foreign-policy speech at noon in D.C. A speechwriter supplied a text, but MSNBC reports that Trump &quot;rewrote it.&quot;</p><p>
<b>--Kevin Madden</b> tells us that for two months, the Trump wave has divided establishment Republicans into two camps: RESIGNATION and RESISTANCE camps - and RESIGNATION is winning. Madden says the too-little, too-late Never Trump movement &quot;only changed the atmospherics, never the fundamentals.&quot; He said it became &quot;pure fantasy&quot; to think you could derail Trump with the momentum he was picking up, going back to at least Nevada on Feb. 23.</p><p><b>--Daniel says that of 39 states that have voted (including D.C.), Trump has won 26.</b> Cruz carried 10 (Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, Wyoming), Rubio snared two (D.C. and Minnesota) and Kasich took Ohio.
</p><p><b>--Cruz has gotten less than 25% of the vote</b> in 20 states (including D.C.).</p><p><b>MIKE MURPHY,</b> who headed the lavishly funded pro-Jeb super PAC, to Brian Williams, co-anchoring MSNBC's coverage with Rachel Maddow: &quot;The lights are going out across the Republican Party tonight. ... It's like Trump has built a lab to blow a general election, even against Hillary Clinton.&quot;</p><p><b>--Murphy predicted Trump</b> will &quot;turn on the insult comedy&quot; against Clinton: &quot;But her big judo win is to play the victim. ... Jeb was the anti-Trump; now we have Trump. ... And Kasich, the guy who COULD win a general election, can't get arrested.&quot;</p> <p><b>TRUMP
</b> phoner with &quot;Morning Joe&quot; this morning: &quot;I don't even know if it's going to be Hillary. ... I don't know what's happening with the email scandal. ... People that did far less are sitting in jail cells.&quot; On his campaign HQ in Trump Tower: &quot;The day the campaign ends, I get the highest rents in the city.&quot; On the camps in his campaign: &quot;Paul actually gets along very well with Corey. They have different functions ... very separate functions.&quot;</p><p> <b>HILLARY CLINTON,
</b> after winning four of five states last night (all but Rhode Island): &quot;Now, the other day, Mr. Trump accused me of playing the 'woman card.' (JEERING) Well, if fighting for women's health care, and paid family leave, and equal pay is playing the 'woman card,' then deal me in.&quot;</p><p><b>TOP TWEETS: </b>Cook Political Report's<b> Dave Wasserman </b>(@Redistrict): &quot;<b>Trump carried every single county and congressional district that voted today&quot;</b> ...
