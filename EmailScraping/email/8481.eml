Washington Post =96 Erik Wemple

Last night, Jonathan Weisman tweeted out an opinion piece from The Post by =
Robert Kagan: =93This is how fascism comes to America.=94 Via Trump, that i=
s. =93This is how fascism comes to America, not with jackboots and salutes =
(although there have been salutes, and a whiff of violence) but with a tele=

=92 popular resentments and insecurities, and with an entire national polit=
ical party =97 out of ambition or blind party loyalty, or simply out of fea=
r =97 falling into line behind him,=94 writes Kagan.

A deputy Washington editor at the Times, Weisman included a portion of that=
 sentence in his tweet =97 along with another tweet on a related topic =97 =
and let it fly. Hatred responded.


The Southern Poverty Law Center, among many other Twitter observers, took n=
ote of Weisman=92s efforts to highlight this scourge:

On Twitter and other social-media platforms, it can be difficult to determi=
ne who supports whom. Yes, several of the people making anti-Semitic statem=
ents had references to the presumptive GOP nominee in their Twitter IDs and=
 photos, though those references could mean anything. What has been clear f=
or some time is that criticizing Trump while being Jewish is a hazardous on=
line activity. On Daily Wire, Ben Shapiro, a prominent conservative comment=
ator, documented the anti-Semitic backlash that followed his own opinionati=
ng about Trump. And cited more from where that came:


It=92s not just me, of course. Jake Tapper of CNN now says he=92s received =
anti-Semitic tweets =93all day.=94 My friend Bethany Mandel, another orthod=
ox Jew who opposes Trump, just bought herself a gun out of fear of unhinged=
 Trump supporters. John Podhoretz of Commentary says he receives tweets con=
sistently from =93literally neo-Nazi White supremacists, all anonymous=85I =
don=92t think I can attribute being a supporter of Trump to being a validat=
or or an expresser of these opinions, but something was let loose by him.=
=94 Noah Rothman of Commentary tweets, =93It never ends. Blocking doesn=92t=
 help either. They have lists, on which I seem to find myself.=94

Shapiro Wednesday offered a further exploration at National Review under th=
e headline, =93Trump=92s Anti-Semitic Supporters.=94 He writes: =93I=92ve e=
xperienced more pure, unadulterated anti-Semitism since coming out against =
Trump=92s candidacy than at any other time in my political career. Trump su=
pporters have threatened me and other Jews who hold my viewpoint. They=92ve=
 blown up my e-mail inbox with anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. They greet=
ed the birth of my second child by calling for me, my wife, and two childre=
n to be thrown into a gas chamber.=94

As this blog reported, journalist Julia Ioffe filed a police report after r=
eceiving anti-Semitic threats stemming from the backlash against her story =
in GQ about Melania Trump. =93The Trumps have a record of kind of whistling=
 their followers into action,=94 Ioffe said at the time.
