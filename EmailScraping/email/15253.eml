PRESS BRIEFING

BY PRINCIPAL DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY ERIC SCHULTZ,

SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY,=20

AND DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR FOR=20

STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS BEN RHODES

=A0

Park Hyatt=20

Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam

=A0

=A0

7:16 P.M. ICT

=A0

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 MR. SCHULTZ:=A0 We are very fortunate to be joined by the Se=
cretary of State, who is going to give us an update on the President's vi=
sit after day two of three, here in Vietnam.=A0 He's also going to offer =
some personal reflections on what this trip has meant and the progress we=
've seen, I'd say, in the years since you've led this effort a few decade=
s ago.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 So I'm going to turn it over to Secretary Kerry, who will ha=
ve time for just a few questions.=A0 And then Ben and I will stick around=
 for a few extra questions.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 SECRETARY KERRY:=A0 Eric, thank you very much.=A0 Sorry to s=
idetrack there for a minute.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 Good evening, everybody.=A0 It's really a pleasure for me to=
 be here with all of you, but it's also a tremendous privilege to be here=
 with President Obama on what is unquestionably an historic demarcation e=
ffort.=A0=20

=A0

I have to tell you that for many years I have looked forward to a time wh=
en people would hear the word "Vietnam" or the name "Vietnam" and think m=
ore of a country than a conflict.=A0 And with President Obama's visit thi=
s week, with the crowds that we saw along the street today, the remarkabl=
y warm and generous welcome, the unbelievable excitement of people that w=
e are here with a President of the United States at this moment is absolu=
tely palpable, and I think it is a demarcation point.=A0=20

=A0

I think, clearly, we will never fail to honor the sacrifice of those who =
fought here and of what their dreams were for this country.=A0 But I thin=
k one can say genuinely, definitively, without failing to honor past serv=
ice, that we have reached a new point in our relationship now.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 I will tell you that when I first came over here around 1990=
 or so, not that many Americans had traveled at that point in time offici=
ally, from the government of the United States certainly.=A0 And in Hanoi=
, there literally were very few cars.=A0 None of the street lights worked=
.=A0 People were still in black pajamas.=A0 There was a law that said the=
y couldn=92t talk to foreigners.=A0 And the embargo was in full force.=A0=
 There were just bicycles, massive numbers of bicycles and people riding =
to work.=A0 Very few hotels in the city.=A0 I stayed in a government gues=
thouse.=A0 And the transition from that moment -- when America decided we=
 were going to sort of start to become engaged -- until now is nothing le=
ss than stunning.=A0=20

=A0

This is a country that is practicing a raging form of capitalism.=A0 It i=
s engaged and has been called the tiger of this region.=A0 And I think th=
at, by every measure, this is a significant emphasis on the policy of Pre=
sident Obama with respect to the rebalance to Asia.=A0 This is a prime ex=
ample of the way in which the United States has been able to forge a new =
relationship out of the ashes of war and to create real peace.=A0=20

=A0

And when people ask what does it mean to have lifted the lethal weapons b=
an -- what it means is it's normal.=A0 We don=92t have lethal embargoes o=
r bans for countries that we treat normally.=A0 And after 20 years of rec=
ognition, it is time to honor that normality.=A0 The fact is that it is a=
lso a very important decision in terms of making certain that Vietnam has=
 the equipment that it needs in order to be able to defend itself and to =
stand up as part of ASEAN, as part of a rule of law, a rules-based struct=
ure -- which is what President Obama has been trying to seek both in TPP,=
 as well as in our overall policy.=A0=20

=A0

So this visit and this moment, in my judgement, reaffirms what has been c=
lear for some period of time to many of us:=A0 The United States and Viet=
nam no longer define our relationship by the enmities of a bygone era.=A0=
=20

=A0

Now, I often point out that the young adults of America and Vietnam were =
both born after normal relations were established 20 years ago, and what =
was extraordinary to my generation could not be more routine or natural t=
o them.=A0 And all you have to do is look and measure this transformation=
 that has taken place.=A0=20

=A0

Twenty years ago, there were fewer than 60,000 American visitors to Vietn=
am on an annual basis; today, there's nearly half a million.=A0 Twenty ye=
ars ago, bilateral trade in goods was only $450 million; today, it's more=
 than $45 billion a year.=A0 Twenty years ago, there were fewer than 800 =
Vietnamese students studying in the United States; today, nearly 19,000.=A0=
 And through the Lower Mekong Initiative -- a place that I know well -- w=
e are working to improve Vietnam's resilience to the effects of climate c=
hange, focusing our aid on clean energy and the development of sustainabl=
e infrastructure and ecosystem resource management.=A0=20

=A0

We=92re also working together, excitingly, in the academic arena.=A0 And =
I can't emphasize how key that is in terms of transformational long-term =
impact of a relationship.=A0 The Institute of International Education, Ar=
izona State University, Harvard Medical School, the University of Hawaii =
all have partnerships with institutions in Vietnam, several involving par=
ticipation by the private sector.=A0 And tomorrow, I will have the privil=
ege of launching the formal launch of Fulbright University Vietnam, which=
 will be a full-fledged, non-profit and totally academically free institu=
tion.=A0=20

=A0

Our two countries are also cooperating on security issues -- something th=
at none of us could have imagined 45, 50 years ago.=A0 Our Coast Guards a=
nd our Navies are working together.=A0 Vietnam is a partner in America's =
Global Peace Operations Initiative.=A0 In 2014, Vietnam began contributin=
g to U.N. peace operations in a small way, but with plans to send enginee=
ring, medical, and other specialized units in the future.=A0 And along wi=
th allies and partners, the United States is helping personnel from Vietn=
am to prepare for those deployments.=A0 And one of the things we did in t=
he course of this visit is sign an agreement which will permit the pre-de=
ployment of supplies in the event of emergency.=A0=20

=A0

So let me just emphasize that measure this visit alone, major business ag=
reements -- Pratt & Whitney, Boeing, wind energy, the Fulbright Universit=
y, the Peace Corps coming to Vietnam, the Mekong Delta Initiative, Fulbri=
ght University, TPP=A0 -- it seems to me that that alone, without all the=
 other things I added, defines rebalance impact and a relationship that i=
s really nothing less than transformational.

=A0

Now, there is no question, as the President said earlier today, that our =
government and the government in Hanoi continue to have differences, obvi=
ously.=A0 The fact that we are cooperating in all of these other areas do=
esn=92t mean there is a sudden erasing of fundamental differences in how =
we organize our governments, how we deal directly with our citizens.=A0 A=
nd so the good news, however, is we're talking about that.=A0 We talk abo=
ut that very directly.=A0 We talked about it today.=A0 We talked about it=
 yesterday.=A0=20

=A0

And today, you saw the President meet with some folks in their civil soci=
ety -- people who represented disabilities, people who represented church=
, and so forth.=A0 That could not have been imagined 20 years ago.=A0 Tha=
t meeting today, while it lacked three people that had been invited and w=
e hoped had been there, was still a remarkably significant meeting becaus=
e it took place. And that's the first time a President of the United Stat=
es sat down with civil society in the capital of this country and talked =
in an open way as he did today.

=A0

It is clear that we and Vietnam are engaged today in a way I can tell you=
 that none of us could have imagined during the war. And it is clear that=
 Vietnam is reaching towards this globalized world of modernity.=A0 After=
 all, millions of people in Vietnam already freely use -- I think it's so=
mething like 38 million people and some 29 million or so under the age of=
 25 who use Facebook.=A0 So thousands of Vietnamese workers are already f=
reely associating to defend their interests.=A0 And under TPP, those righ=
ts will be increased, as well as environmental protection.

=A0

So the Vietnamese are the ones who are asking for the guarantees of a gov=
ernment to put into law the recognition of their freedoms.=A0 And there w=
ill be, shortly, an effort within the parliament to codify certain rights=
 in ways that are reflected in the constitution of the country.

=A0

So the more progress that occurs in those areas, the more likely it is --=
 as President Obama explained very clearly -- the more likely it is that =
our bilateral relationship, which has already come so far, is going to be=
 able to reach even greater potential.=A0 And that=92s why we're here.=A0=
 That's why this is significant.=A0 And that's why I think this is worth =
the fight.

=A0

So with that, I am happy to open it up.=A0=20

=A0

Q=A0=A0=A0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.=A0 The China Daily is warning the Un=
ited States not to spark a fire in Asia.=A0 And I'm quoting now:=A0 "The =
United States and Vietnam must not spark a regional tinderbox" -- noting =
the concerns of trying to curb the rise of China.=A0 What's your reaction=
 to what the China Daily has written? And if I could follow, based on wha=
t you've observed in the time since 1990, is there any doubt in your mind=
 that there will be an even greater openness here in Vietnam in the years=
 to come?=A0 And how can you manage that as a country that still has so m=
any fundamental differences between governments?=20

=A0

SECRETARY KERRY:=A0 Between -- I'm sorry.

=A0

Q=A0=A0=A0 The U.S. and Vietnam.

=A0

SECRETARY KERRY:=A0 Well, look, we're making progress.=A0 Last year -- I =
mean, they released -- I'm going to take the second part of your question=
 first.=A0 They released a number of prisoners.=A0 They had about 160, I =
think; 60 or so were released. There had been increased freedoms of worsh=
ip.=A0 The church has been recognized.=A0 Handicapped efforts have been r=
ecognized.=A0 So there's some progress.=A0 Is it as much progress as we w=
ant?=A0 No, not at all.=A0 And there is going to be a journey ahead of us=
 while we continue to work on those things.=A0 But I really think that's =
at the center of President Obama's foreign policy.=A0 That's what we're d=
oing in Burma.=A0 That's what we're doing in Cuba.=A0 That's what we're d=
oing in Iraq and in other places, Afghanistan, where transformation is ta=
king place.

=A0

Folks, I got to tell you, we are impatient by nature, and that's good.=A0=
 We get a lot done in America because we are impatient.=A0 But you can't =
be impatient -- you can be impatient, but you've got to also recognize th=
e time it takes for cultural transformation, for generational transformat=
ion, for people to be able to learn how to manage and exercise rights and=
 certain freedoms.=A0 And we went through that ourselves.=A0 I mean, how =
can we turn away from our own history?=A0 It was only in the 1960s, when =
I was in college, that we began the battle -- or the next evolution of th=
e battle to have full voting rights in America and full civil rights, and=
 Jim Crow.=A0 That wasn=92t so long ago in our history, for a country tha=
t began with the Constitution we began with.

=A0

So for countries that don=92t begin with that, or don=92t have any of tha=
t tradition, we have to recognize that road that they're on is going to b=
e a roller coaster ride to some degree.=A0 But as long as it's moving in =
the same direction, that's what is important.=A0 As long as the United St=
ates itself remains faithful to our values and we are always pushing in t=
he right direction, as the President did today, I think we can absolutely=
 look forward with confidence to this transformation taking hold.=20

=A0

I personally, I do not know how -- I mean, I was sitting on the Commerce =
Committee of the Senate when we rewrote the rules for telecommunications.=
=A0 We didn=92t even think about information management.=A0 And this was =
1996.=A0 Look at where we are 20 years later in our own revolution in ter=
ms of that technology and communication.=A0 I came into a Senate that did=
n=92t have an Internet, and look at where we are.=A0 So life changes, and=
 it will change here -- because you cannot function in the modern, global=
ized marketplace of today without opening up ultimately, and without bein=
g able to be competitive in terms of purchase, sales, communications, and=
 so forth.

=A0

Now, on the first part of your question about China, I'd say several thin=
gs.=A0 First of all, this is not about China.=A0 Nothing that we did here=
 or are doing here is focused on China.=A0 It is focused on the fastest-g=
rowing marketplace in the world.=A0 It is focused on a rules-based order =
that we have consistently -- Republican and Democrat, President alike -- =
held at the center of our policies.=A0 And it is focused on strengthening=
 the ability in this region to be able to promote that rules-based order.=
=A0=20

=A0

Now, part of that rules-based order, frankly, requires the peaceful resol=
ution of the problems of the South China Sea.=A0 We have consistently urg=
ed in private conversations and public conversation with China that they =
respect the rule of law and that they engage diplomatically with the coun=
tries that are contesting claims and that they not move unilaterally.=A0=20=


=A0

If you want to point to the possibilities of tinderbox and of perhaps ign=
iting something, I would caution China, as President Obama and others hav=
e, to not unilaterally move to engage in reclamation activities and milit=
arization of islands and areas that are part of the claims that are in co=
ntest today. We don=92t take a position on those claims.=A0 China should =
note that.=A0 We're not saying China is wrong in its claims; we're simply=
 saying, resolve it peacefully, resolve it through a rules-based structur=
e.=20

=A0

So nothing we've done here is out of the ordinary.=A0 We have lifted an e=
mbargo, which was out of the ordinary.=A0 The embargo itself, the lethal =
arms embargo, was a restraint on normality.=A0 Now we have a normal relat=
ion, so we lift it.=A0 That's very normal.=A0 Not out of order, and certa=
inly not inflammatory.=A0 And I hope China will read this correctly, beca=
use our hope is for normal respect for maritime law and for the relations=
hips that are so key in this region in terms of resolving the code of con=
duct and moving forward in a diplomatic way to resolve these differences.=


=A0

Q=A0=A0=A0 Secretary Kerry, while we have you, on another topic -- the ba=
ttle against ISIS and terrorism.=A0 So what extent now, when you look at =
the Egypt air crash, is the thinking that this was or was not an act of t=
errorism?=A0 And we're hearing a lot about the battle for Fallujah beginn=
ing.=A0 How do you see that playing out? How long is that going to take?=A0=
 Why now?=A0 And do you think this is really -- there's been a lot said a=
bout how the administration has turned the tide in this effort.=20

=A0

SECRETARY KERRY:=A0 I don=92t have any information -- particularly on the=
 road like this, I just have no way of authoritatively commenting at all =
on the EgyptAir crash.=A0 I've seen catches of the news, and I'm reading =
what people are reading.=A0 But I don=92t think it's my job to surmise.=A0=
 I think that has too many consequences.=A0 So let's let the investigator=
s investigate and let them do what they're doing, and we'll see where we =
are.=20

=A0

With respect to ISIS, what Fallujah means is that we're continuing the pr=
ocess that President Obama has put in play to defeat ISIS.=A0 And we're g=
oing to defeat them.=A0 I've said that again and again.=A0 And I think I'=
ve been backed up week to week by the increased efforts that we are seein=
g be successful -- with communities in Iraq being returned to their inhab=
itants, with ISIS being compressed in its area of activity, though it is =
still lethal.=A0 We know that.=A0 And we see them lashing out, to some de=
gree, because they're not able to take territory.=A0 They're not able to =
mount lasting holding actions.=A0 They can attack and move, and that's st=
ill dangerous, and we see them with suicide attacks, obviously.=A0 And un=
fortunately, that will continue, as we continue to press the battle again=
st them.

=A0

But I think what Fallujah means is that our generals and our cooperation =
with the Iraqis and with the full coalition of 66 countries have a clear =
strategy.=A0 They're moving very systematically.=A0 And I believe we're m=
aking progress.=A0 And the President has instructed all of us to try to t=
hink about ways in which we could accelerate that, for obvious reasons.=A0=
 The faster we can eliminate Daesh as a threat force, the better off the =
world would be, because it has impacts on economies, it has impacts on tr=
avel, it has an impact on the threat and safety.=A0 And so that's the Pre=
sident's instructions to us, and that's what we're trying to do.=20

=A0

Q=A0=A0=A0 Mr. Secretary, you said that this is not about China. But it's=
 hard not to see many of the President's comments:=A0 "Big nations should=
 not bully smaller ones."=A0 "Vietnam is an independent and sovereign nat=
ion, and no other nation can impose its will on you."=A0 These were all b=
ig lines that got a lot of applause today, and they got a lot of applause=
 because the audience clearly understood that the President was talking a=
bout China and Vietnam.=A0 And so huge parts of this trip are clearly dir=
ected at pushing back on China, both in the South China Sea.=A0 And the P=
resident is going to be going to Japan.=A0 He's going to talk about proli=
feration.=A0 In this region, the most important proliferation problem is =
in North Korea, which is Chinese technology gotten through Pakistan, and =
China has the most leverage in the North Korea situation.=A0 So again and=
 again -- even TPP is a trade organization that you all have sort set up =
without China, in the Pacific.=A0 So it's hard not to see each one of the=
 things that you're talking about, the speeches that you're making -- and=
 even now you're talking about you immediately pivot to the South China S=
ea -- without seeing China being a huge part of this trip.

=A0

SECRETARY KERRY:=A0 Well, I think what's happening is you're confusing, i=
f you don=92t mind my saying so, respectfully, the focus and the directio=
n of what we're doing versus some of the impact, collaterally, of what we=
 do.=A0 I'd obviously be either misleading you or pretty stupid if I didn=
=92t suggest that order in the South China Sea and encouraging peaceful r=
esolution and making sure that ASEAN is strong doesn=92t collaterally hav=
e an impact on perceptions there.=A0 But it's not focused on China.=A0=20=


=A0

President Obama could not have been more clear.=A0 I've said it a hundred=
 times -- and we mean it:=A0 We welcome the rise of a strong China, a Chi=
na that assumes responsibilities as a global superpower leader, and plays=
 out its responsibilities in ways that are helpful.=A0 And that means enc=
ouraging peace and stability.=A0 As long as China is playing by those rul=
es and adopting it, none of this is focused on China.=A0 So it's really s=
omething we have worked on in our country and stood for since World War I=
I.=A0 I mean, we've been working on this rules-based structure, freedom o=
f navigation, codes of conduct, peaceful resolution, diplomatic process.=A0=
 That's the hallmark of American policy for throughout the Cold War and b=
eyond.=A0=20

=A0

So it's not specifically focused on China.=A0 Obviously there is a collat=
eral impact to the degree China chooses to do X, Y or Z.=A0 And so we're =
very clear -- we encourage China not to be unilaterally militarizing, uni=
laterally moving.=A0 But we're not focused on China.=A0 I just can't say =
it enough.=A0 We're focused on this region.=A0 And I think the primary th=
reat of the entire region is North Korea, Kim Jong-un, and the proliferat=
ion activities of the DPRK.=A0 That's the primary threat.=A0 It's actuall=
y perhaps the lead threat globally with respect to one of the two or thre=
e currently.=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=20

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 I think these guys are going to take over here.=A0 I answere=
d more than I thought I was doing.=A0=20

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 Thank you.=A0 Good to see you.=A0 Thank you very much.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 MR. SCHULTZ:=A0 Ben and I are your second act and happy to t=
ake any remaining questions.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 Nancy.=A0=20

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 Q=A0=A0=A0 Eric, did the administration push back at all -- =
with the activists that who were denied access to the meeting this mornin=
g -- with the Vietnamese government, register a protest or anything?

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 MR. RHODES:=A0 Yes, absolutely.=A0 We've made clear that whe=
n the President travels around the world, he meets with government and he=
 meets with civil society.=A0 And we've done that here in Vietnam.=A0 We'=
ve done it in Cuba.=A0 We did it in Myanmar.=A0 We did it in Ethiopia.=A0=
 And we set up a similar meeting here.=A0 This morning -- or overnight, r=
eally, we learned that there were a number of individuals who were being =
prevented from, or dissuaded from attending the meeting with the Presiden=
t.=A0 We protested to the government.=A0 Ultimately we were able to meet =
with the group of people that the President had this morning, which inclu=
ded advocates around issues like freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, =
disability rights, freedom of worship.=A0 But there were a number of indi=
viduals who were not able to attend.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 Q=A0=A0=A0 Was that --=20

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 MR. RHODES:=A0 No.=A0 No, I think the Secretary identified t=
he number of people.=A0 What I'd say, though, is number one, as Secretary=
 Kerry pointed out, the fact of an American President or any head of stat=
e or government meeting with independent civil society in Hanoi is unprec=
edented.=A0 And so, clearly, this was something that was a source of sign=
ificant discomfort for the government.=A0 And that alone I think demonstr=
ates that we're able, through this relationship, to hear from different v=
oices and to lift up these different issues. And I think certainly the Pr=
esident benefited from this conversation today, and made the point that w=
e're going to continue to remain engaged with civil society.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 To the second point I'd make, going forward, even as we are =
elevating this relationship in a host of ways -- our security cooperation=
, our commercial ties, our people-to-people ties -- clearly human rights =
is going to continue to be on the agenda.=A0 And that's part of what we w=
anted to demonstrate today, that we're not beyond all of our differences,=
 we're going to continue to raise them.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 And then the final point I'd make on this is we believe very=
 strongly that we are going to be better-positioned to advance human righ=
ts through a policy of engagement; that if we were to withhold the relati=
onship with the United States and try to use the fact of cooperation in d=
ifferent areas to pressure the government to do certain things, we would =
be less able to, over time, encourage positive reform than if we're here =
and we're engaged.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 And if you look at the transformation that's taking place he=
re that Secretary Kerry talked about, that includes things that are very =
empowering like the ability for people to have access to Facebook, like t=
he enormous interconnectivity that you have between young people here and=
 young people across the region and around the world.=A0 The opening that=
 takes place is creating a space for discussion and debate and dialogue t=
hat is new.=A0 And as the Secretary said, we've seen some progress in rec=
ent years, but certainly not sufficient progress.=A0 And we're going to c=
ontinue to press the government on all those issues.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 MR. SCHULTZ:=A0 Can I just add one thing for Nancy, which is=
 the President, I think it's noteworthy, chose to raise this in front of =
all of you -- meaning he thinks it's significant enough to make sure that=
 all of you knew about this.=A0 And I think that's indicative of the fact=
 that he=92s going to press on this and make it a priority moving forward=
.=A0=20

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 Michelle.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 Q=A0=A0=A0 Last night, during his speech to the Vietnamese p=
eople, he seemed to be approaching this extremely delicately.=A0 Given th=
at this had just happened, and given that just yesterday the BBC was told=
 by the government to stop reporting -- I mean, it's kind of happening bo=
ldly while he=92s here.=A0 But he approached the whole thing by first tal=
king about the problems that were in the U.S.=A0 I mean, that's how he op=
ened the discussion.=A0 And then he didn=92t get very specific or critica=
l in any way.=A0 He just said -- he kind of extolled the virtues of certa=
in freedoms in a general sense.=A0 It seemed like he was much harder on t=
he subject and more specific in places like Kenya, for example.=A0 Was th=
ere a reason he had to approach this so delicately?

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 MR. RHODES:=A0 Well, first of all, I think there=92s been a =
consistent way in which the President raises these issues anywhere -- Cub=
a, Vietnam, Kenya.=A0 He discusses what we stand for, what we believe, an=
d the universal values that he thinks that all people should be able to h=
ave access to, including freedom of speech, freedom of assembly.=A0 So I =
don't think he was speaking delicately in any way.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 In fact, that speech was broadcast here in Vietnam, and thos=
e are not things that people in Vietnam hear frequently.=A0 They do not h=
ear leaders of the stature of President Obama discussing those values ope=
nly in Hanoi with that kind of platform.=A0=20

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 Secondly, look, we have a very complicated history in Vietna=
m.=A0 And I think it's important that the President make clear here that =
we recognize that history and we're not coming here to impose a system of=
 government on Vietnam, but rather we're coming here to engage the Vietna=
mese people.=A0 And part of that engagement is going to be advocacy aroun=
d these issues.=A0 And people know what we stand for.=A0 They know that w=
e raise individual human rights cases.=A0 They know that we advocate for =
the types of reforms that we=92d like to see here.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 For instance, if you look at TPP, a main sticking point here=
 in Vietnam was the fact that in order to come into TPP they had to allow=
 for independent labor unions; they had to allow for fair wages; they had=
 to allow for limitations on workers=92 hours.=A0 Those are human rights =
advances that were embedded with TPP.=A0 That=92s how engagement allows u=
s to advance the types of reforms that we=92d like to see.=A0=20

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 And the last thing I'd say about this, Michelle, is Vietnam =
is not going to change its political system overnight, and it's not going=
 to change its political system because we tell them to. What=92s going t=
o ultimately bring greater change and reform to Vietnam is the Vietnamese=
 people.=A0 We've already seen that progress take place in the last two d=
ecades, during normalization.=A0 In some ways, we've seen it accelerate i=
n recent years as people are more connected and expect more of their gove=
rnment.=A0 We've seen laws pass that begin to address issues of human rig=
hts, including the ability of people to protest their detention.=A0 And u=
ltimately we'd like to see laws pass that address issues like freedom of =
speech and assembly.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 But it's going to take time for Vietnam to evolve.=A0 But th=
e final thing I'd say about this is, I think the Vietnamese people know w=
hat the President stands for.=A0 And if you look at the reception that he=
 got in Hanoi and the reception that he got coming into Ho Chi Minh City,=
 I've traveled all over the world with President Obama, and other than My=
anmar, I can't think of another country that received him like that.=A0 A=
nd those are people who know exactly what he stands for and believe that =
he=92s helping the Vietnamese people achieve a better future.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 Q=A0=A0=A0 Another question on about Navy access here in Vie=
tnam. We just got back from the Philippines, involved in exercises, and w=
e have now the ability to access five bases in the Philippines we gave up=
 in 1991.=A0 Now we're back in.=A0 Another one is the South China Sea.=A0=
 Many of the allies we've got are giving us more access to bases and use =
for the Navy.=A0 What=92s going to happen in Vietnam?=A0 When and how, an=
d how big?

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 MR. RHODES:=A0 Well, look, I obviously don't want to compare=
 the relationship that we have with the Philippines, a treaty ally, to Vi=
etnam.=A0 What I would say is we are deepening our cooperation with Vietn=
am in a number of areas.=A0 One of those includes maritime security and h=
aving discussions around how we can help enhance their capability with re=
spect to maritime security.=A0=20

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 We've also had conversations about disaster response and how=
 we can perhaps pre-position certain resources that can make Vietnam more=
 effective in working with other ASEAN partners in responding to natural =
disasters.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 I think, going forward, as we consider the relationship betw=
een the United States Nave and Vietnam, that's going to be an evolving co=
nversation.=A0 And when it comes to discussions related to what types of =
cooperation we might pursue, what types of port calls there may be, I thi=
nk that's going to be an unfolding process in the coming months and years=
.=A0 But the fact of the matter is, by deepening our collaboration with V=
ietnam and with ASEAN, by removing this vestige of the Cold War with the =
lethal arms ban, we're able to have a conversation with Vietnam like we h=
ave with other countries within ASEAN, and we expect them to be an import=
ant partner of the United States just like we've been deepening cooperati=
on with other ASEAN countries.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 MR. SCHULTZ:=A0 We have time for one or two more.=A0=20

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 Margaret.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 Q=A0=A0=A0 Ben, can you tell us if you got any specific comm=
itment on this trip from the Vietnamese government on human rights, and w=
hether that leverage, specifically when it comes to weapons, is gone?=A0 =
Or is this like a case-by-case basis -- every time they ask for another p=
iece of policing equipment, we have a conversation with them about freedo=
m of assembly?=A0 How does that work?=A0 And can you also give us your re=
ad on the level of instability in North Korea, given that the Secretary j=
ust said it's the lead global threat?

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 MR. RHODES:=A0 Well, on North Korea, I think he=92s referrin=
g to the fact of their nuclear program and that they=92re certainly the l=
eading threat as it relates to nuclear proliferation.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 With respect to commitments, yes, the government did indicat=
e to us that it was committed to pursuing additional reforms in this spac=
e.=A0 In some cases, that involves the implementation of laws that have b=
een passed that allow for more rights.=A0 In some cases, they were refere=
ncing individuals who we have raised with them.=A0 And in some cases, the=
y were referring to upcoming legislative efforts that they might pursue.=A0=
=20

=A0

So it's a broad discussion around the trajectory of progress here in Viet=
nam that focused both on individual human rights cases of concern -- like=
 Father L=FD who was released the other day -- but also legal reform that=
 codifies certain rights, like the ability of people to protest their det=
ention, seek greater transparency from the government, seek the right to =
assemble, seek the ability to have a civil society that is independent of=
 the government.=A0=20

=A0

So this will be an ongoing conversation.=A0 The government indicates to u=
s that they are moving in a direction on a number of these issues.=A0 We =
will wait and see whether or not they follow through on those commitments=
.=A0 We didn=92t define this relationship as a strict quid pro quo as it =
relates to our engagement as against specific steps.=A0 But what they cer=
tainly understand is the ability of us to cooperate depends upon continue=
d progress on a range of issues.=A0=20

=A0

And so just as TPP requires them to fulfill their labor commitments -- be=
cause if they are not allowing for the registration of independent labor =
unions, and if they=92re not allowing for the types of workers=92 rights =
that are codified in TPP, they won't get the benefits of TPP, because TPP=
 is enforceable.=A0 So they have to do those things, they have to impleme=
nt those laws in order to get those protections lifted and have the marke=
t access that comes with the agreement.=A0 That's an indication of how a =
broadening relationship maintains the ability for us to raise human right=
s concerns.

=A0

In the lethal weapons ban, we have now lifted the prohibition on the sale=
 of weapons.=A0 But as with any other country, we do review each weapons =
sale on a case-by-case basis. So it will continue to be the case that as =
we are considering certain arms sales to Vietnam we will look at a variet=
y of factors, and it's certainly going to be the case if our administrati=
on, Congress, future administrations, I'm sure, will look at the trajecto=
ry of the human rights picture in Vietnam as they make those decisions.=A0=
 So that continues to be the case going forward.

=A0

Again, we believe that, broadly speaking, what we've done through normali=
zation with Vietnam is empowering the Vietnamese people.=A0 And it is ult=
imately leading to a future where they=92re going to have greater rights =
and opportunities, and that we can push that process forward much more ef=
fectively by deepening the relationship than by pulling back.

=A0

Q=A0=A0=A0 Any other -- to be free?=20

=A0

MR. RHODES:=A0 Again, they=92ve released a number of prisoners over the l=
ast year.=A0 We would like to see an additional number of political priso=
ners released.=A0 I'm not going to make predictions about specific cases.=
=A0 But it's fair to say, here, as in other countries in this part of the=
 world, we are regularly raising through human rights dialogue and other =
channels, including on this visit, cases that are of concern to us.

=A0

Q=A0=A0=A0 Can you shed some light on the pushback related to last night,=
 such as who was involved and what the Vietnamese government=92s response=
 was?=A0 And secondly, the President said a number of times that the Unit=
ed States is demonstrating its commitment to fully normalizing relations.=
=A0 Can you explain what is left to do to fully normalize relations?=A0 I=
s it just a matter of implementing decisions that have already been made,=
 or are there additional policy decisions that need to be made?

=A0

MR. RHODES:=A0 Well, again, as we became aware of individuals who were fa=
cing obstacles in attending the meeting we raised those concerns at a var=
iety of levels.=A0 Secretary Kerry was certainly involved in those effort=
s, as were people in the White House.=A0 This is something that we've don=
e in many countries.=A0 We faced obstacles and concerns around participan=
ts in those types of meetings in other countries, and we raised them thro=
ugh the White House and through the State Department.=A0=20

=A0

Ultimately, we were not able to have every participant at this meeting.=A0=
 But I do want to be very clear that we have to use or engagement as a me=
ans of raising these issues.=A0 If the President wasn=92t pursuing this p=
olicy, he wouldn't be sitting in Hanoi with a series of civil society and=
 human rights activists talking about these issue and talking about them =
publicly, and giving a speech about it that reached the Vietnamese people=
.=A0 So if we just stayed in Washington and expressed our concerns we=92d=
 never have the opportunity to have that type of conversation.=A0 And tha=
t's a conversation that has never taken place before in Hanoi -- which is=
 precisely why the government was so uncomfortable with it.=A0=20

=A0

And we deeply believe that by being engaged, by coming here, we are havin=
g a conversation that would not otherwise happen.=A0 We are able to hear =
the voices of those civil society activists.=A0 That gives a greater plat=
form to their ideas, just as we're able to engage with and hear the ideas=
 of the government.=A0=20

=A0

And if you look at the Vietnamese people, again, if our focus is on how a=
re we helping the Vietnamese people, there are few countries in the world=
 where the United States is as highly regarded as here in Vietnam.=A0 You=
 see that in every public opinion survey; you see it on the streets here =
today.=A0 I think that is a testament to the fact that the Vietnamese bel=
ieve this relationship benefits them.

=A0

Q=A0=A0=A0 Can you say what it was that did to -- were they physically ar=
rested and hauled off to jail?=A0 Was it house arrest? Warned?=A0 And to =
the best of your knowledge now, are they free to move about?

=A0

MR. RHODES:=A0 Look, Matt, I would just say that there are a variety of w=
ays in which governments seek to make clear to people that they shouldn=92=
t attend a certain meeting.=A0 I personally am not familiar enough with e=
ach individual case, I think, to be able to give an accurate rendering th=
at I know to be completely true.=A0 What we do know is that, using a vari=
ety of different methods, a number of people felt either prevented from o=
r uncomfortable attending the meeting.=A0 And President Obama volunteered=
 that to the press because he wanted people to know that not everybody wh=
o was invited was able to attend.

=A0

We will certainly be following up and have followed up to make sure that =
all of those individuals are free and they=92re not being in any way subj=
ect to any punishment.=A0 And I think that's something that our embassy d=
oes on a regular basis.=A0 These are individuals who are regular sources =
of information to not just the United States but to advocates on these is=
sues around the world.=A0 And they=92re the ones who have the courage, fr=
ankly, to take those positions.=A0 They=92re the ones who assume the hard=
ship of staking out positions that may put them on the other side of the =
government here.

=A0

But what our commitment is, is, number one, that we're going to engage th=
em just as we engage the government as part of normalization. =A0Number t=
wo, we=92re going to continue to raise these issues privately with the go=
vernment.=A0 And number three, that President Obama discusses these issue=
s publicly as well.

=A0

And, look, the public engagement that we have here should not be underest=
imated.=A0 When you talk about a Fulbright University opening, it=92s the=
 first independently accredited university that has the ability to exerci=
se a freedom of academic pursuits that is not subject to government restr=
ictions.=A0 When you talk about our exchange programs, that=92s connectin=
g people from Vietnam to other countries and to the United States, and we=
 have 12,000 people participating in that exchange program.=A0 So there a=
re all kinds of ways that we are able to demonstrate our commitment to un=
iversal values, including advocacy on individual cases.

=A0

MR. SCHULTZ:=A0 Carol asked about normalizing.=A0=20

=A0

MR. RHODES:=A0 Well, look, we have, I think, in many ways removed many of=
 the vestiges of the past as it relates to Vietnam.=A0 The prohibition on=
 lethal arms sales was certainly a vestige of the Cold War.=A0 And, frank=
ly, the Vietnamese agreement to allow the Peace Corps to come here I thin=
k demonstrates on their side that they are putting behind a vestige of th=
e Cold War.

=A0

At the same time, having a normal relationship with another country does =
not necessarily define the extent to which your partnership develops.=A0 =
So, for instance, we were discussing earlier our military and security co=
operation.=A0 We are at a nascent stage of that collaboration.=A0 As we d=
evelop a closer relationship with Vietnam and as we look at all of the di=
fferent factors in our relationship, I think that will have a bearing on =
just how close the collaboration is between our militaries on a variety o=
f issues.

=A0

Similarly, again, as I said on TPP, as they implement their commitments, =
that will have a direct bearing on how much they are able to benefit from=
 the agreement, assuming it=92s approved by the respective parliaments an=
d our Congress.

=A0

So, again, we have, I think, removed the barriers to this relationship, b=
ut at the same time, we haven=92t established just how far it can evolve.=
=A0 And at the end of the day, we always have the closest relationships w=
ith countries with whom we share broad interests and a shared set of valu=
es.=A0 And as this relationship evolves, I think we=92ll see how far it c=
an go.

=A0

Now, as Secretary Kerry said, if you look at how far it=92s come in just =
the last 20 years, it suggests that there=92s enormous potential here in =
Vietnam.=A0 And look, we=92re -- I know we=92re spending a lot of time, a=
s we appropriately should be, discussing the very serious differences bet=
ween our governments, but it is worth stepping back and reflecting on jus=
t how extraordinary it is, given the history between our two countries, g=
iven the war, that you have a U.S. President received as he=92s been by b=
oth the government and people of Vietnam on this trip.

=A0

This is different from many other countries around the world when you loo=
k at the history.=A0 And the fact that we are able to be where we are tod=
ay with Vietnam in terms of our commercial ties, our security ties, our p=
eople-to-people ties, I think it=92s a testament to the fact that countri=
es get more out of pursuing peaceful cooperation than they do out of conf=
lict.

=A0

MR. SCHULTZ:=A0 Let=92s take one more.=A0 Kevin.

=A0

Q=A0=A0=A0 Thanks.=A0 I appreciate that, Eric.=A0 Ben, I probably speak f=
or a lot of people in the room who are looking for you to sort of unpack =
some of the comments that you made in that Times Magazine article, in par=
ticular when you said =93The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old,=
 and their only experience consists of being on the political campaigns.=A0=
 It=92s a sea change. They literally know nothing.=94=A0 And I=92m sure t=
hat struck a lot of people as a curious statement by you.=A0=20

=A0

And if I could follow, you=92ve been accused of misleading the timeline a=
s far as the negotiations were concerned on the Iran nuclear deal.=A0 It =
was also suggested that you were promoting a narrative that the administr=
ation was dealing with moderates when in fact, it was all along dealing w=
ith hardliners.=A0 If you could clarify that, I'd appreciate it.=A0 I kno=
w you=92ve discussed this at least in part, but I don't think I've had a =
chance to engage you personally or have you comment on these things on ca=
mera.

=A0

MR. RHODES:=A0 Well, look, on the second question, many of you saw the Me=
dium post I wrote after the article came out.=A0 I mean, you all covered =
the Iran deal for many years.=A0 At no point did I say in that article th=
at there was any false narrative as it relates to the Iranian hardliners =
and moderates.

=A0

I think if we review the facts, they=92re very clear.=A0 We had wanted to=
 pursue an Iranian nuclear deal for a very long time.=A0 President Obama =
campaigned on that platform.=A0 I went to work for him in the summer of 2=
007, when he was having a debate in the Democratic primary about whether =
to pursue diplomacy with Iran.=A0 So that was no secret.

=A0

The fact of the matter is we pursued several efforts to make progress on =
nuclear negotiations in the first term, some of them quite public, and th=
ey did not go anywhere.=A0 It is also true that we were able to establish=
 that we could have a discreet channel of communication with the Iranians=
 through Oman during the President=92s first term.=A0 However, those disc=
ussions did not go anywhere.=A0 They were not substantive.=A0 They did no=
t in any way foresee the deal that was ultimately reached.=A0 All it was,=
 was our ability to establish that we could have a discussion with the Ir=
anians, which we were already having in other forums, like the P5+1.

=A0

So this was dead in the water in our first term.=A0 And that=92s precisel=
y why we spent so much time imposing sanctions on Iran, because we did no=
t see a change in the position of the Iranian government.=A0=20

=A0

It is also undeniably true that that changed after the election of Hassan=
 Rouhani.=A0 And what happened after President Rouhani was elected is tha=
t President Obama wrote him a letter and indicated that we wanted to purs=
ue a dialogue on nuclear issues.=A0 Very quickly, that led to the negotia=
tions that began in secret between the United States and Iran in the summ=
er leading to the fall of 2013, and then very quickly moved into the P5+1=
 negotiations that were launched at the U.N. General Assembly in New York=
 in 2013.

=A0

So there may be a debate that is I think a very important debate about th=
e degree of moderation of different elements of the Iranian leadership --=
 the difference between a Qasem Soleimani or President Rouhani, for insta=
nce, in their respective views of Iranian foreign policy.=A0 Some people =
may not want to apply the term =93moderate=94 to anybody in Iran, given t=
heir continued violation of international norms and support for terrorism=
.=A0 But the fact of the matter is, President Rouhani, Foreign Minister Z=
arif approached the nuclear issue in a different way, in a way that was m=
ore moderate than the previous regime under President Ahmadinejad.=A0 And=
 we were able to get a nuclear deal because there was a different regime =
and different administration in Tehran.

=A0

So with respect to the timeline, we have always been absolutely clear abo=
ut the timeline of our interest in an Iranian nuclear deal and how it unf=
olded.=A0 And, frankly, the areas of that timeline that remained secret f=
or some time have long ago since been publicly discussed, including our t=
alks in Oman.

=A0

So I do think that it=92s very important -- I know, while there=92s debat=
e on the Iranian issue as it relates to the article, that it=92s clear th=
at what we=92ve said at podiums like this for years is what I would say t=
o any of you, which is that there was a sea change after the election of =
President Rouhani.=A0 That doesn=92t mean that we agree with everything t=
hat he does.=A0 There continue to be ballistic missile launches.=A0 There=
 continues to be support for terrorism.=A0 There continues to be threats =
to Israel.

But on the specific question of the nuclear deal, we did have an administ=
ration under President Rouhani that was different from the administration=
 of President Ahmadinejad.=A0 And I think that there=92s just -- anybody =
who=92s covered this issue and looked at it closely would find that to be=
 the case, irrespective of other views of Iranian actions or U.S. policy.=


=A0

On the first question, all I=92d say is, look, I=92ve been doing this job=
 for over seven years.=A0 I=92ve been working with some of you for that e=
ntire time or part of that time.=A0 I think that you all know how much I =
take seriously our responsibility to engage with you and to try to commun=
icate our policies on very complicated and difficult issues.=A0=20

=A0

So I don=92t want to take bits of quotes that were pulled out of differen=
t places and get into a media commentary here.=A0 I addressed this the ot=
her day and I=92ll say something similar here today, which is simply that=
 I think those of you who have worked with me know how much I respect the=
 role of the media in what we do, how much, even if I might disagree with=
 you, I want you to understand where we=92re coming from and what we=92re=
 trying to accomplish, and, frankly, how much I enjoy being on trips just=
 like this and talking about issues like this remarkable transformation i=
n our relationship with Vietnam.

=A0

So, again, I just think that the people who know me and have worked with =
me know exactly how I approach these issues, how I think about my respons=
ibilities and my engagement with you.=A0 It=92s something that I really h=
ave enjoyed for the last seven and a half years and will enjoy doing for =
the next several months.

=A0

MR. SCHULTZ:=A0 Thank you.=A0=20

=A0

Q=A0=A0=A0 So did you or did you not say that --

=A0

MR. RHODES:=A0 Again, I'm not going to parse quotes.=A0 Again, I'm tellin=
g you I think I have a body of experience that you all are familiar with,=
 and you can make your judgments based on that body of experience.=A0=20

=A0

MR. SCHULTZ:=A0 Thank you.=A0=A0 =A0=20

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; We are v=
ery fortunate to be joined by the Secretary of State, who is going to give =
us an update on the President's visit after day two of three, here in Vietn=
am.&nbsp; He's also going to offer some personal reflections on
 what this trip has meant and the progress we've seen, I'd say, in the year=
s since you've led this effort a few decades ago.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I'm going to turn it ove=
r to Secretary Kerry, who will have time for just a few questions.&nbsp; An=
d then Ben and I will stick around for a few extra questions.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECRETARY KERRY:&nbsp; Eric=
, thank you very much.&nbsp; Sorry to sidetrack there for a minute.<p></p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good evening, everybody.&nb=
sp; It's really a pleasure for me to be here with all of you, but it's also=
 a tremendous privilege to be here with President Obama on what is unquesti=
onably an historic demarcation effort.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I have to tell you that f=
or many years I have looked forward to a time when people would hear the wo=
rd &quot;Vietnam&quot; or the name &quot;Vietnam&quot; and think more of a =
country than a conflict.&nbsp; And with President Obama's visit
 this week, with the crowds that we saw along the street today, the remarka=
bly warm and generous welcome, the unbelievable excitement of people that w=
e are here with a President of the United States at this moment is absolute=
ly palpable, and I think it is a
 demarcation point.&nbsp; <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think, clearly, we will=
 never fail to honor the sacrifice of those who fought here and of what the=
ir dreams were for this country.&nbsp; But I think one can say genuinely, d=
efinitively, without failing to honor past
 service, that we have reached a new point in our relationship now.<p></p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will tell you that when I=
 first came over here around 1990 or so, not that many Americans had travel=
ed at that point in time officially, from the government of the United Stat=
es certainly.&nbsp; And in Hanoi, there literally were very
 few cars.&nbsp; None of the street lights worked.&nbsp; People were still =
in black pajamas.&nbsp; There was a law that said they couldn=92t talk to f=
oreigners.&nbsp; And the embargo was in full force.&nbsp; There were just b=
icycles, massive numbers of bicycles and people riding to work.&nbsp;
 Very few hotels in the city.&nbsp; I stayed in a government guesthouse.&nb=
sp; And the transition from that moment -- when America decided we were goi=
ng to sort of start to become engaged -- until now is nothing less than stu=
nning.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">This is a country that is=
 practicing a raging form of capitalism.&nbsp; It is engaged and has been c=
alled the tiger of this region.&nbsp; And I think that, by every measure, t=
his is a significant emphasis on the policy of
 President Obama with respect to the rebalance to Asia.&nbsp; This is a pri=
me example of the way in which the United States has been able to forge a n=
ew relationship out of the ashes of war and to create real peace.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And when people ask what =
does it mean to have lifted the lethal weapons ban -- what it means is it's=
 normal.&nbsp; We don=92t have lethal embargoes or bans for countries that =
we treat normally.&nbsp; And after 20 years of recognition,
 it is time to honor that normality.&nbsp; The fact is that it is also a ve=
ry important decision in terms of making certain that Vietnam has the equip=
ment that it needs in order to be able to defend itself and to stand up as =
part of ASEAN, as part of a rule of law,
 a rules-based structure -- which is what President Obama has been trying t=
o seek both in TPP, as well as in our overall policy.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So this visit and this mo=
ment, in my judgement, reaffirms what has been clear for some period of tim=
e to many of us:&nbsp; The United States and Vietnam no longer define our r=
elationship by the enmities of a bygone era.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, I often point out th=
at the young adults of America and Vietnam were both born after normal rela=
tions were established 20 years ago, and what was extraordinary to my gener=
ation could not be more routine or natural
 to them.&nbsp; And all you have to do is look and measure this transformat=
ion that has taken place.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Twenty years ago, there w=
ere fewer than 60,000 American visitors to Vietnam on an annual basis; toda=
y, there's nearly half a million.&nbsp; Twenty years ago, bilateral trade i=
n goods was only $450 million; today, it's
 more than $45 billion a year.&nbsp; Twenty years ago, there were fewer tha=
n 800 Vietnamese students studying in the United States; today, nearly 19,0=
00.&nbsp; And through the Lower Mekong Initiative -- a place that I know we=
ll -- we are working to improve Vietnam's
 resilience to the effects of climate change, focusing our aid on clean ene=
rgy and the development of sustainable infrastructure and ecosystem resourc=
e management.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We=92re also working toge=
ther, excitingly, in the academic arena.&nbsp; And I can't emphasize how ke=
y that is in terms of transformational long-term impact of a relationship.&=
nbsp; The Institute of International Education,
 Arizona State University, Harvard Medical School, the University of Hawaii=
 all have partnerships with institutions in Vietnam, several involving part=
icipation by the private sector.&nbsp; And tomorrow, I will have the privil=
ege of launching the formal launch of
 Fulbright University Vietnam, which will be a full-fledged, non-profit and=
 totally academically free institution.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Our two countries are als=
o cooperating on security issues -- something that none of us could have im=
agined 45, 50 years ago.&nbsp; Our Coast Guards and our Navies are working =
together.&nbsp; Vietnam is a partner in America's
 Global Peace Operations Initiative.&nbsp; In 2014, Vietnam began contribut=
ing to U.N. peace operations in a small way, but with plans to send enginee=
ring, medical, and other specialized units in the future.&nbsp; And along w=
ith allies and partners, the United States
 is helping personnel from Vietnam to prepare for those deployments.&nbsp; =
And one of the things we did in the course of this visit is sign an agreeme=
nt which will permit the pre-deployment of supplies in the event of emergen=
cy.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So let me just emphasize =
that measure this visit alone, major business agreements -- Pratt &amp; Whi=
tney, Boeing, wind energy, the Fulbright University, the Peace Corps coming=
 to Vietnam, the Mekong Delta Initiative,
 Fulbright University, TPP&nbsp; -- it seems to me that that alone, without=
 all the other things I added, defines rebalance impact and a relationship =
that is really nothing less than transformational.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, there is no question=
, as the President said earlier today, that our government and the governme=
nt in Hanoi continue to have differences, obviously.&nbsp; The fact that we=
 are cooperating in all of these other areas
 doesn=92t mean there is a sudden erasing of fundamental differences in how=
 we organize our governments, how we deal directly with our citizens.&nbsp;=
 And so the good news, however, is we're talking about that.&nbsp; We talk =
about that very directly.&nbsp; We talked about it
 today.&nbsp; We talked about it yesterday.&nbsp; <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And today, you saw the Pr=
esident meet with some folks in their civil society -- people who represent=
ed disabilities, people who represented church, and so forth.&nbsp; That co=
uld not have been imagined 20 years ago.&nbsp;
 That meeting today, while it lacked three people that had been invited and=
 we hoped had been there, was still a remarkably significant meeting becaus=
e it took place. And that's the first time a President of the United States=
 sat down with civil society in
 the capital of this country and talked in an open way as he did today.<p><=
/p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">It is clear that we and V=
ietnam are engaged today in a way I can tell you that none of us could have=
 imagined during the war. And it is clear that Vietnam is reaching towards =
this globalized world of modernity.&nbsp;
 After all, millions of people in Vietnam already freely use -- I think it'=
s something like 38 million people and some 29 million or so under the age =
of 25 who use Facebook.&nbsp; So thousands of Vietnamese workers are alread=
y freely associating to defend their
 interests.&nbsp; And under TPP, those rights will be increased, as well as=
 environmental protection.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the Vietnamese are the=
 ones who are asking for the guarantees of a government to put into law the=
 recognition of their freedoms.&nbsp; And there will be, shortly, an effort=
 within the parliament to codify certain
 rights in ways that are reflected in the constitution of the country.<p></=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the more progress that=
 occurs in those areas, the more likely it is -- as President Obama explain=
ed very clearly -- the more likely it is that our bilateral relationship, w=
hich has already come so far, is going
 to be able to reach even greater potential.&nbsp; And that=92s why we're h=
ere.&nbsp; That's why this is significant.&nbsp; And that's why I think thi=
s is worth the fight.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So with that, I am happy =
to open it up.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank=
 you, Mr. Secretary.&nbsp; The China Daily is warning the United States not=
 to spark a fire in Asia.&nbsp; And I'm quoting now:&nbsp; &quot;The United=
 States and Vietnam must not spark a regional tinderbox&quot; -- noting the
 concerns of trying to curb the rise of China.&nbsp; What's your reaction t=
o what the China Daily has written? And if I could follow, based on what yo=
u've observed in the time since 1990, is there any doubt in your mind that =
there will be an even greater openness
 here in Vietnam in the years to come?&nbsp; And how can you manage that as=
 a country that still has so many fundamental differences between governmen=
ts?
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">SECRETARY KERRY:&nbsp; Be=

 be a journey ahead of us while we continue to work on those things.&nbsp; =
But I really think that's at the center of President Obama's foreign policy=
.&nbsp; That's what we're doing in Burma.&nbsp; That's what we're doing in =
Cuba.&nbsp; That's what we're doing in Iraq and in other
 places, Afghanistan, where transformation is taking place.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Folks, I got to tell you,=
 we are impatient by nature, and that's good.&nbsp; We get a lot done in Am=
erica because we are impatient.&nbsp; But you can't be impatient -- you can=
 be impatient, but you've got to also recognize
 the time it takes for cultural transformation, for generational transforma=
tion, for people to be able to learn how to manage and exercise rights and =
certain freedoms.&nbsp; And we went through that ourselves.&nbsp; I mean, h=
ow can we turn away from our own history?&nbsp;
 It was only in the 1960s, when I was in college, that we began the battle =
-- or the next evolution of the battle to have full voting rights in Americ=
a and full civil rights, and Jim Crow.&nbsp; That wasn=92t so long ago in o=
ur history, for a country that began with
 the Constitution we began with.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So for countries that don=
=92t begin with that, or don=92t have any of that tradition, we have to rec=
ognize that road that they're on is going to be a roller coaster ride to so=
me degree.&nbsp; But as long as it's moving in
 the same direction, that's what is important.&nbsp; As long as the United =
States itself remains faithful to our values and we are always pushing in t=
he right direction, as the President did today, I think we can absolutely l=
ook forward with confidence to this transformation
 taking hold. <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I personally, I do not kn=
ow how -- I mean, I was sitting on the Commerce Committee of the Senate whe=
n we rewrote the rules for telecommunications.&nbsp; We didn=92t even think=
 about information management.&nbsp; And this was
 1996.&nbsp; Look at where we are 20 years later in our own revolution in t=
erms of that technology and communication.&nbsp; I came into a Senate that =
didn=92t have an Internet, and look at where we are.&nbsp; So life changes,=
 and it will change here -- because you cannot function
 in the modern, globalized marketplace of today without opening up ultimate=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, on the first part of=
 your question about China, I'd say several things.&nbsp; First of all, thi=
s is not about China.&nbsp; Nothing that we did here or are doing here is f=
ocused on China.&nbsp; It is focused on the fastest-growing
 marketplace in the world.&nbsp; It is focused on a rules-based order that =
we have consistently -- Republican and Democrat, President alike -- held at=
 the center of our policies.&nbsp; And it is focused on strengthening the a=
bility in this region to be able to promote
 that rules-based order.&nbsp; <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, part of that rules-b=
ased order, frankly, requires the peaceful resolution of the problems of th=
e South China Sea.&nbsp; We have consistently urged in private conversation=
s and public conversation with China that
 they respect the rule of law and that they engage diplomatically with the =
countries that are contesting claims and that they not move unilaterally.&n=
bsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">If you want to point to t=
he possibilities of tinderbox and of perhaps igniting something, I would ca=
ution China, as President Obama and others have, to not unilaterally move t=
o engage in reclamation activities and
 militarization of islands and areas that are part of the claims that are i=
n contest today. We don=92t take a position on those claims.&nbsp; China sh=
ould note that.&nbsp; We're not saying China is wrong in its claims; we're =
simply saying, resolve it peacefully, resolve
 it through a rules-based structure. <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So nothing we've done her=
e is out of the ordinary.&nbsp; We have lifted an embargo, which was out of=
 the ordinary.&nbsp; The embargo itself, the lethal arms embargo, was a res=
traint on normality.&nbsp; Now we have a normal relation,
 so we lift it.&nbsp; That's very normal.&nbsp; Not out of order, and certa=
inly not inflammatory.&nbsp; And I hope China will read this correctly, bec=
ause our hope is for normal respect for maritime law and for the relationsh=

 resolving the code of conduct and moving forward in a diplomatic way to re=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">SECRETARY KERRY:&nbsp; I =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">With respect to ISIS, wha=
t Fallujah means is that we're continuing the process that President Obama =
has put in play to defeat ISIS.&nbsp; And we're going to defeat them.&nbsp;=
 I've said that again and again.&nbsp; And I think
 I've been backed up week to week by the increased efforts that we are seei=
ng be successful -- with communities in Iraq being returned to their inhabi=
tants, with ISIS being compressed in its area of activity, though it is sti=
ll lethal.&nbsp; We know that.&nbsp; And we
 see them lashing out, to some degree, because they're not able to take ter=

 can attack and move, and that's still dangerous, and we see them with suic=

 that will continue, as we continue to press the battle against them.<p></p=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But I think what Fallujah=
 means is that our generals and our cooperation with the Iraqis and with th=
e full coalition of 66 countries have a clear strategy.&nbsp; They're movin=
g very systematically.&nbsp; And I believe we're
 making progress.&nbsp; And the President has instructed all of us to try t=
o think about ways in which we could accelerate that, for obvious reasons.&=
nbsp; The faster we can eliminate Daesh as a threat force, the better off t=
he world would be, because it has impacts
 on economies, it has impacts on travel, it has an impact on the threat and=

 what we're trying to do.

on,
 and no other nation can impose its will on you.&quot;&nbsp; These were all=
 big lines that got a lot of applause today, and they got a lot of applause=
 because the audience clearly understood that the President was talking abo=
ut China and Vietnam.&nbsp; And so huge parts of
 this trip are clearly directed at pushing back on China, both in the South=

's going to talk about proliferation.&nbsp; In this region, the most import=

 is Chinese technology gotten through Pakistan, and China has the most leve=

a trade organization that you all have sort set up without China, in the Pa=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">SECRETARY KERRY:&nbsp; We=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">President Obama could not=

I are your second act and happy to take any remaining questions.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nancy.&nbsp; <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eric, d=
id the administration push back at all -- with the activists that who were =
denied access to the meeting this morning -- with the Vietnamese government=
, register a protest or anything?<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Yes, abso=
lutely.&nbsp; We've made clear that when the President travels around the w=
orld, he meets with government and he meets with civil society.&nbsp; And w=
e've done that here in Vietnam.&nbsp; We've done it in Cuba.&nbsp; We did i=
t in
 Myanmar.&nbsp; We did it in Ethiopia.&nbsp; And we set up a similar meetin=
g here.&nbsp; This morning -- or overnight, really, we learned that there w=
ere a number of individuals who were being prevented from, or dissuaded fro=
m attending the meeting with the President.&nbsp; We
 protested to the government.&nbsp; Ultimately we were able to meet with th=
e group of people that the President had this morning, which included advoc=
ates around issues like freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, disability =
rights, freedom of worship.&nbsp; But there
 were a number of individuals who were not able to attend.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was tha=
t -- <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. RHODES:&nbsp; No.&nbsp;=
 No, I think the Secretary identified the number of people.&nbsp; What I'd =
say, though, is number one, as Secretary Kerry pointed out, the fact of an =
American President or any head of state or government meeting with independ=
ent
 civil society in Hanoi is unprecedented.&nbsp; And so, clearly, this was s=
omething that was a source of significant discomfort for the government.&nb=
sp; And that alone I think demonstrates that we're able, through this relat=
ionship, to hear from different voices and
 to lift up these different issues. And I think certainly the President ben=
efited from this conversation today, and made the point that we're going to=
 continue to remain engaged with civil society.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the second point I'd mak=
e, going forward, even as we are elevating this relationship in a host of w=
ays -- our security cooperation, our commercial ties, our people-to-people =
ties -- clearly human rights is going to continue to be
 on the agenda.&nbsp; And that's part of what we wanted to demonstrate toda=
y, that we're not beyond all of our differences, we're going to continue to=
 raise them.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then the final point I'=
d make on this is we believe very strongly that we are going to be better-p=
ositioned to advance human rights through a policy of engagement; that if w=
e were to withhold the relationship with the United States
 and try to use the fact of cooperation in different areas to pressure the =
government to do certain things, we would be less able to, over time, encou=
rage positive reform than if we're here and we're engaged.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if you look at the tran=
sformation that's taking place here that Secretary Kerry talked about, that=
 includes things that are very empowering like the ability for people to ha=
ve access to Facebook, like the enormous interconnectivity
 that you have between young people here and young people across the region=
 and around the world.&nbsp; The opening that takes place is creating a spa=
ce for discussion and debate and dialogue that is new.&nbsp; And as the Sec=
retary said, we've seen some progress in recent
 years, but certainly not sufficient progress.&nbsp; And we're going to con=
tinue to press the government on all those issues.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Can I ju=
st add one thing for Nancy, which is the President, I think it's noteworthy=
, chose to raise this in front of all of you -- meaning he thinks it's sign=
ificant enough to make sure that all of you knew about this.&nbsp;
 And I think that's indicative of the fact that he=92s going to press on th=
is and make it a priority moving forward.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last ni=
ght, during his speech to the Vietnamese people, he seemed to be approachin=
g this extremely delicately.&nbsp; Given that this had just happened, and g=
iven that just yesterday the BBC was told by the government to stop reporti=
ng
 -- I mean, it's kind of happening boldly while he=92s here.&nbsp; But he a=
pproached the whole thing by first talking about the problems that were in =
the U.S.&nbsp; I mean, that's how he opened the discussion.&nbsp; And then =
he didn=92t get very specific or critical in any way.&nbsp;
 He just said -- he kind of extolled the virtues of certain freedoms in a g=
eneral sense.&nbsp; It seemed like he was much harder on the subject and mo=
re specific in places like Kenya, for example.&nbsp; Was there a reason he =
had to approach this so delicately?<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Well, fir=
st of all, I think there=92s been a consistent way in which the President r=
aises these issues anywhere -- Cuba, Vietnam, Kenya.&nbsp; He discusses wha=
t we stand for, what we believe, and the universal values that he
 thinks that all people should be able to have access to, including freedom=
 of speech, freedom of assembly.&nbsp; So I don't think he was speaking del=
icately in any way.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, that speech was br=
oadcast here in Vietnam, and those are not things that people in Vietnam he=
ar frequently.&nbsp; They do not hear leaders of the stature of President O=
bama discussing those values openly in Hanoi with that kind
 of platform.&nbsp; <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, look, we have a v=
ery complicated history in Vietnam.&nbsp; And I think it's important that t=
he President make clear here that we recognize that history and we're not c=
oming here to impose a system of government on Vietnam, but
 rather we're coming here to engage the Vietnamese people.&nbsp; And part o=
f that engagement is going to be advocacy around these issues.&nbsp; And pe=
ople know what we stand for.&nbsp; They know that we raise individual human=
 rights cases.&nbsp; They know that we advocate for
 the types of reforms that we=92d like to see here.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, if you look a=
t TPP, a main sticking point here in Vietnam was the fact that in order to =
come into TPP they had to allow for independent labor unions; they had to a=
llow for fair wages; they had to allow for limitations
 on workers=92 hours.&nbsp; Those are human rights advances that were embed=
ded with TPP.&nbsp; That=92s how engagement allows us to advance the types =
of reforms that we=92d like to see.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the last thing I'd say =
about this, Michelle, is Vietnam is not going to change its political syste=
m overnight, and it's not going to change its political system because we t=
ell them to. What=92s going to ultimately bring greater
 change and reform to Vietnam is the Vietnamese people.&nbsp; We've already=
 seen that progress take place in the last two decades, during normalizatio=
n.&nbsp; In some ways, we've seen it accelerate in recent years as people a=
re more connected and expect more of their
 government.&nbsp; We've seen laws pass that begin to address issues of hum=
an rights, including the ability of people to protest their detention.&nbsp=
; And ultimately we'd like to see laws pass that address issues like freedo=
m of speech and assembly.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it's going to take time=
 for Vietnam to evolve.&nbsp; But the final thing I'd say about this is, I =
think the Vietnamese people know what the President stands for.&nbsp; And i=
f you look at the reception that he got in Hanoi and the reception
 that he got coming into Ho Chi Minh City, I've traveled all over the world=
 with President Obama, and other than Myanmar, I can't think of another cou=
ntry that received him like that.&nbsp; And those are people who know exact=
ly what he stands for and believe that
 he=92s helping the Vietnamese people achieve a better future.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another=
 question on about Navy access here in Vietnam. We just got back from the P=
hilippines, involved in exercises, and we have now the ability to access fi=
ve bases in the Philippines we gave up in 1991.&nbsp; Now we're back in.&nb=
sp;
 Another one is the South China Sea.&nbsp; Many of the allies we've got are=
 giving us more access to bases and use for the Navy.&nbsp; What=92s going =
to happen in Vietnam?&nbsp; When and how, and how big?<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Well, loo=
k, I obviously don't want to compare the relationship that we have with the=
 Philippines, a treaty ally, to Vietnam.&nbsp; What I would say is we are d=
eepening our cooperation with Vietnam in a number of areas.&nbsp; One
 of those includes maritime security and having discussions around how we c=
an help enhance their capability with respect to maritime security.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've also had conversation=
s about disaster response and how we can perhaps pre-position certain resou=
rces that can make Vietnam more effective in working with other ASEAN partn=
ers in responding to natural disasters.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think, going forward, as =
we consider the relationship between the United States Nave and Vietnam, th=
at's going to be an evolving conversation.&nbsp; And when it comes to discu=
ssions related to what types of cooperation we might pursue,
 what types of port calls there may be, I think that's going to be an unfol=
ding process in the coming months and years.&nbsp; But the fact of the matt=
er is, by deepening our collaboration with Vietnam and with ASEAN, by remov=
ing this vestige of the Cold War with
 the lethal arms ban, we're able to have a conversation with Vietnam like w=
e have with other countries within ASEAN, and we expect them to be an impor=
tant partner of the United States just like we've been deepening cooperatio=
n with other ASEAN countries.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; We have =
time for one or two more.&nbsp; <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ben, ca=
n you tell us if you got any specific commitment on this trip from the Viet=
namese government on human rights, and whether that leverage, specifically =
when it comes to weapons, is gone?&nbsp; Or is this like a case-by-case bas=
is
 -- every time they ask for another piece of policing equipment, we have a =
conversation with them about freedom of assembly?&nbsp; How does that work?=
&nbsp; And can you also give us your read on the level of instability in No=
rth Korea, given that the Secretary just said
 it's the lead global threat?<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Well, on =
North Korea, I think he=92s referring to the fact of their nuclear program =
and that they=92re certainly the leading threat as it relates to nuclear pr=
oliferation.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to commitments=
, yes, the government did indicate to us that it was committed to pursuing =
additional reforms in this space.&nbsp; In some cases, that involves the im=
plementation of laws that have been passed that allow for more
 rights.&nbsp; In some cases, they were referencing individuals who we have=
 raised with them.&nbsp; And in some cases, they were referring to upcoming=
 legislative efforts that they might pursue.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So it's a broad discussio=
n around the trajectory of progress here in Vietnam that focused both on in=
dividual human rights cases of concern -- like Father L=FD who was released=
 the other day -- but also legal reform
 that codifies certain rights, like the ability of people to protest their =
detention, seek greater transparency from the government, seek the right to=
 assemble, seek the ability to have a civil society that is independent of =
the government.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So this will be an ongoin=
g conversation.&nbsp; The government indicates to us that they are moving i=
n a direction on a number of these issues.&nbsp; We will wait and see wheth=
er or not they follow through on those commitments.&nbsp;
 We didn=92t define this relationship as a strict quid pro quo as it relate=
s to our engagement as against specific steps.&nbsp; But what they certainl=
y understand is the ability of us to cooperate depends upon continued progr=
ess on a range of issues.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And so just as TPP requir=
es them to fulfill their labor commitments -- because if they are not allow=
ing for the registration of independent labor unions, and if they=92re not =
allowing for the types of workers=92 rights
 that are codified in TPP, they won't get the benefits of TPP, because TPP =
is enforceable.&nbsp; So they have to do those things, they have to impleme=
nt those laws in order to get those protections lifted and have the market =
access that comes with the agreement.&nbsp;
 That's an indication of how a broadening relationship maintains the abilit=
y for us to raise human rights concerns.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">In the lethal weapons ban=
, we have now lifted the prohibition on the sale of weapons.&nbsp; But as w=
ith any other country, we do review each weapons sale on a case-by-case bas=
is. So it will continue to be the case that
 as we are considering certain arms sales to Vietnam we will look at a vari=
ety of factors, and it's certainly going to be the case if our administrati=
on, Congress, future administrations, I'm sure, will look at the trajectory=
 of the human rights picture in
 Vietnam as they make those decisions.&nbsp; So that continues to be the ca=
se going forward.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Again, we believe that, b=
roadly speaking, what we've done through normalization with Vietnam is empo=
wering the Vietnamese people.&nbsp; And it is ultimately leading to a futur=
e where they=92re going to have greater rights
 and opportunities, and that we can push that process forward much more eff=
ectively by deepening the relationship than by pulling back.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any o=

</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Again, =
they=92ve released a number of prisoners over the last year.&nbsp; We would=
 like to see an additional number of political prisoners released.&nbsp; I'=
m not going to make predictions about specific cases.&nbsp;
 But it's fair to say, here, as in other countries in this part of the worl=
d, we are regularly raising through human rights dialogue and other channel=
s, including on this visit, cases that are of concern to us.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can y=
ou shed some light on the pushback related to last night, such as who was i=
nvolved and what the Vietnamese government=92s response was?&nbsp; And seco=
ndly, the President said a number of times that the United
 States is demonstrating its commitment to fully normalizing relations.&nbs=
p; Can you explain what is left to do to fully normalize relations?&nbsp; I=
s it just a matter of implementing decisions that have already been made, o=
r are there additional policy decisions that
 need to be made?<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Well, a=
gain, as we became aware of individuals who were facing obstacles in attend=
ing the meeting we raised those concerns at a variety of levels.&nbsp; Secr=
etary Kerry was certainly involved in those efforts,
 as were people in the White House.&nbsp; This is something that we've done=
 in many countries.&nbsp; We faced obstacles and concerns around participan=
ts in those types of meetings in other countries, and we raised them throug=
h the White House and through the State Department.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Ultimately, we were not a=
ble to have every participant at this meeting.&nbsp; But I do want to be ve=
ry clear that we have to use or engagement as a means of raising these issu=
es.&nbsp; If the President wasn=92t pursuing this
 policy, he wouldn't be sitting in Hanoi with a series of civil society and=
 human rights activists talking about these issue and talking about them pu=
blicly, and giving a speech about it that reached the Vietnamese people.&nb=
sp; So if we just stayed in Washington
 and expressed our concerns we=92d never have the opportunity to have that =
type of conversation.&nbsp; And that's a conversation that has never taken =
place before in Hanoi -- which is precisely why the government was so uncom=
fortable with it.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And we deeply believe tha=
t by being engaged, by coming here, we are having a conversation that would=
 not otherwise happen.&nbsp; We are able to hear the voices of those civil =
society activists.&nbsp; That gives a greater
 platform to their ideas, just as we're able to engage with and hear the id=
eas of the government.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And if you look at the Vi=
etnamese people, again, if our focus is on how are we helping the Vietnames=
e people, there are few countries in the world where the United States is a=
s highly regarded as here in Vietnam.&nbsp;
 You see that in every public opinion survey; you see it on the streets her=
e today.&nbsp; I think that is a testament to the fact that the Vietnamese =
believe this relationship benefits them.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can y=
ou say what it was that did to -- were they physically arrested and hauled =
off to jail?&nbsp; Was it house arrest? Warned?&nbsp; And to the best of yo=
ur knowledge now, are they free to move about?<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Look, M=
att, I would just say that there are a variety of ways in which governments=
 seek to make clear to people that they shouldn=92t attend a certain meetin=
g.&nbsp; I personally am not familiar enough with
 each individual case, I think, to be able to give an accurate rendering th=
at I know to be completely true.&nbsp; What we do know is that, using a var=
iety of different methods, a number of people felt either prevented from or=
 uncomfortable attending the meeting.&nbsp;
 And President Obama volunteered that to the press because he wanted people=
 to know that not everybody who was invited was able to attend.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We will certainly be foll=
owing up and have followed up to make sure that all of those individuals ar=
e free and they=92re not being in any way subject to any punishment.&nbsp; =
And I think that's something that our embassy
 does on a regular basis.&nbsp; These are individuals who are regular sourc=
es of information to not just the United States but to advocates on these i=
ssues around the world.&nbsp; And they=92re the ones who have the courage, =
frankly, to take those positions.&nbsp; They=92re the
 ones who assume the hardship of staking out positions that may put them on=
 the other side of the government here.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But what our commitment i=
s, is, number one, that we're going to engage them just as we engage the go=
vernment as part of normalization. &nbsp;Number two, we=92re going to conti=
nue to raise these issues privately with the
 government.&nbsp; And number three, that President Obama discusses these i=
ssues publicly as well.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And, look, the public eng=
agement that we have here should not be underestimated.&nbsp; When you talk=
 about a Fulbright University opening, it=92s the first independently accre=
dited university that has the ability to exercise
 a freedom of academic pursuits that is not subject to government restricti=
ons.&nbsp; When you talk about our exchange programs, that=92s connecting p=
eople from Vietnam to other countries and to the United States, and we have=
 12,000 people participating in that exchange
 program.&nbsp; So there are all kinds of ways that we are able to demonstr=
ate our commitment to universal values, including advocacy on individual ca=
ses.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Carol =
asked about normalizing.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Well, l=
ook, we have, I think, in many ways removed many of the vestiges of the pas=
t as it relates to Vietnam.&nbsp; The prohibition on lethal arms sales was =
certainly a vestige of the Cold War.&nbsp; And, frankly,
 the Vietnamese agreement to allow the Peace Corps to come here I think dem=
onstrates on their side that they are putting behind a vestige of the Cold =
War.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">At the same time, having =
a normal relationship with another country does not necessarily define the =
extent to which your partnership develops.&nbsp; So, for instance, we were =
discussing earlier our military and security
 cooperation.&nbsp; We are at a nascent stage of that collaboration.&nbsp; =
As we develop a closer relationship with Vietnam and as we look at all of t=
he different factors in our relationship, I think that will have a bearing =
on just how close the collaboration is between
 our militaries on a variety of issues.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Similarly, again, as I sa=
id on TPP, as they implement their commitments, that will have a direct bea=
ring on how much they are able to benefit from the agreement, assuming it=
=92s approved by the respective parliaments
 and our Congress.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, again, we have, I thi=
nk, removed the barriers to this relationship, but at the same time, we hav=
en=92t established just how far it can evolve.&nbsp; And at the end of the =
day, we always have the closest relationships
 with countries with whom we share broad interests and a shared set of valu=
es.&nbsp; And as this relationship evolves, I think we=92ll see how far it =
can go.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, as Secretary Kerry s=
aid, if you look at how far it=92s come in just the last 20 years, it sugge=
sts that there=92s enormous potential here in Vietnam.&nbsp; And look, we=
=92re -- I know we=92re spending a lot of time, as
 we appropriately should be, discussing the very serious differences betwee=
n our governments, but it is worth stepping back and reflecting on just how=
 extraordinary it is, given the history between our two countries, given th=
e war, that you have a U.S. President
 received as he=92s been by both the government and people of Vietnam on th=
is trip.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">This is different from ma=
ny other countries around the world when you look at the history.&nbsp; And=
 the fact that we are able to be where we are today with Vietnam in terms o=
f our commercial ties, our security ties,
 our people-to-people ties, I think it=92s a testament to the fact that cou=
ntries get more out of pursuing peaceful cooperation than they do out of co=
nflict.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Let=92=
s take one more.&nbsp; Kevin.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank=
s.&nbsp; I appreciate that, Eric.&nbsp; Ben, I probably speak for a lot of =
people in the room who are looking for you to sort of unpack some of the co=
mments that you made in that Times Magazine article, in particular
 when you said =93The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and thei=
r only experience consists of being on the political campaigns.&nbsp; It=92=
s a sea change. They literally know nothing.=94&nbsp; And I=92m sure that s=
truck a lot of people as a curious statement by you.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And if I could follow, yo=
u=92ve been accused of misleading the timeline as far as the negotiations w=
ere concerned on the Iran nuclear deal.&nbsp; It was also suggested that yo=
u were promoting a narrative that the administration
 was dealing with moderates when in fact, it was all along dealing with har=
dliners.&nbsp; If you could clarify that, I'd appreciate it.&nbsp; I know y=
ou=92ve discussed this at least in part, but I don't think I've had a chanc=
e to engage you personally or have you comment
 on these things on camera.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Well, l=
ook, on the second question, many of you saw the Medium post I wrote after =
the article came out.&nbsp; I mean, you all covered the Iran deal for many =
years.&nbsp; At no point did I say in that article
 that there was any false narrative as it relates to the Iranian hardliners=
 and moderates.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think if we review the =
facts, they=92re very clear.&nbsp; We had wanted to pursue an Iranian nucle=
ar deal for a very long time.&nbsp; President Obama campaigned on that plat=
form.&nbsp; I went to work for him in the summer of 2007,
 when he was having a debate in the Democratic primary about whether to pur=
sue diplomacy with Iran.&nbsp; So that was no secret.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The fact of the matter is=
 we pursued several efforts to make progress on nuclear negotiations in the=
 first term, some of them quite public, and they did not go anywhere.&nbsp;=
 It is also true that we were able to establish
 that we could have a discreet channel of communication with the Iranians t=
hrough Oman during the President=92s first term.&nbsp; However, those discu=
ssions did not go anywhere.&nbsp; They were not substantive.&nbsp; They did=
 not in any way foresee the deal that was ultimately
 reached.&nbsp; All it was, was our ability to establish that we could have=
 a discussion with the Iranians, which we were already having in other foru=
ms, like the P5&#43;1.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So this was dead in the w=
ater in our first term.&nbsp; And that=92s precisely why we spent so much t=
ime imposing sanctions on Iran, because we did not see a change in the posi=
tion of the Iranian government.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">It is also undeniably tru=
e that that changed after the election of Hassan Rouhani.&nbsp; And what ha=
ppened after President Rouhani was elected is that President Obama wrote hi=
m a letter and indicated that we wanted to
 pursue a dialogue on nuclear issues.&nbsp; Very quickly, that led to the n=
egotiations that began in secret between the United States and Iran in the =
summer leading to the fall of 2013, and then very quickly moved into the P5=
&#43;1 negotiations that were launched at
 the U.N. General Assembly in New York in 2013.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So there may be a debate =
that is I think a very important debate about the degree of moderation of d=
ifferent elements of the Iranian leadership -- the difference between a Qas=
em Soleimani or President Rouhani, for
 instance, in their respective views of Iranian foreign policy.&nbsp; Some =
people may not want to apply the term =93moderate=94 to anybody in Iran, gi=
ven their continued violation of international norms and support for terror=
ism.&nbsp; But the fact of the matter is, President
 Rouhani, Foreign Minister Zarif approached the nuclear issue in a differen=
t way, in a way that was more moderate than the previous regime under Presi=
dent Ahmadinejad.&nbsp; And we were able to get a nuclear deal because ther=
e was a different regime and different
 administration in Tehran.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So with respect to the ti=
meline, we have always been absolutely clear about the timeline of our inte=
rest in an Iranian nuclear deal and how it unfolded.&nbsp; And, frankly, th=
e areas of that timeline that remained secret
 for some time have long ago since been publicly discussed, including our t=
alks in Oman.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I do think that it=92s=
 very important -- I know, while there=92s debate on the Iranian issue as i=
t relates to the article, that it=92s clear that what we=92ve said at podiu=
ms like this for years is what I would say to
 any of you, which is that there was a sea change after the election of Pre=
sident Rouhani.&nbsp; That doesn=92t mean that we agree with everything tha=
t he does.&nbsp; There continue to be ballistic missile launches.&nbsp; The=
re continues to be support for terrorism.&nbsp; There
 continues to be threats to Israel.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">But on the specific question of the nuclear deal, we=
 did have an administration under President Rouhani that was different from=
 the administration of President Ahmadinejad.&nbsp; And I think that there=
=92s just -- anybody who=92s covered this issue
 and looked at it closely would find that to be the case, irrespective of o=
ther views of Iranian actions or U.S. policy.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">On the first question, al=
l I=92d say is, look, I=92ve been doing this job for over seven years.&nbsp=
; I=92ve been working with some of you for that entire time or part of that=
 time.&nbsp; I think that you all know how much I take
 seriously our responsibility to engage with you and to try to communicate =
our policies on very complicated and difficult issues.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I don=92t want to take=
 bits of quotes that were pulled out of different places and get into a med=
ia commentary here.&nbsp; I addressed this the other day and I=92ll say som=
ething similar here today, which is simply that
 I think those of you who have worked with me know how much I respect the r=
ole of the media in what we do, how much, even if I might disagree with you=
, I want you to understand where we=92re coming from and what we=92re tryin=
g to accomplish, and, frankly, how much
 I enjoy being on trips just like this and talking about issues like this r=
emarkable transformation in our relationship with Vietnam.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, again, I just think t=
hat the people who know me and have worked with me know exactly how I appro=
ach these issues, how I think about my responsibilities and my engagement w=
ith you.&nbsp; It=92s something that I really
 have enjoyed for the last seven and a half years and will enjoy doing for =
the next several months.<p></p></p>
