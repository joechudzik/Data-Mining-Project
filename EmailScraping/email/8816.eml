Can you introduce Ryan to Donna.  He needs to connect with her for this Newsweek story.

Sure, happy to discuss. We can do a call or just meet in person next week. For context, we get far fewer opportunities on CNN and MSNBC than we do on Fox.

She's also not on to play nice with the hosts, she's been very assertive in defense of our candidates and our values when she has gone on. And quite frankly the DNC was being much harsher with Fox previously, but Bernie Sanders actually forced our hand when he agreed to do a town hall on Fox. The Clinton camp had to do the same, and once our two candidates were on there for that town hall, our resistance to Fox didn't hold water in the same way. So we're taking advantage of their huge audience and their willingness to give us airtime. They still beat the hell out of the rest of the networks on ratings, so it has been good for us as the DNC.

Let me know when you want to talk, Ryan.
