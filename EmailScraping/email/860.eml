By Mike Allen (@mikeallen; mallen@politico.com) and Daniel Lippman (@dlippman; dlippman@politico.com)

Good Tuesday morning. It's the Acela primary: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island. Mark Halperin says on "Morning Joe" that after tonight, Trump is likely to be "on track" for a clinch, and might even get "a cushion."

 

YOU'RE INVITED to our "Funny or Die" Playbook Lunch on Friday ... NEW HEADLINER added for our annual pre-WHCA Celebrity Edition: David Litt -- who wrote Obama jokes for WHCA dinners as a White House speechwriter, and now is head writer/producer for Funny or Die D.C. - will join Billy Eichner, star of "Billy on the Street" and Hulu's "Difficult People," plus Mike Farah, Funny or Die's president of production. We'll talk about the intersection of comedy and politics, and have some fun. Doors open 11:30 a.m. Friday at The Newseum, 555 Pennsylvania Avenue NW. Program at noon. #PlaybookLunch RSVP http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=99a82374dbba75d0c523c80233befebff871d1671f8d310089c2221205187f5d

 

TROUBLE IN TRUMP TOWER - "Trump rejects new adviser's push to make him 'presidential':Frustrated with Manafort, the GOP front-runner shifts some power back to campaign manager Lewandowski," by Ken Vogel and Eli Stokols: "Trump became upset late last week when he learned from media reports that Manafort privately told Republican leaders that the billionaire reality TV star was 'projecting an image' for voters and would begin toning down his rhetoric ... Trump also expressed concern about Manafort bringing several former lobbying colleagues into the campaign ... Now Trump is taking steps to return some authority to Manafort's chief internal rival, campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. ...

"Lewandowski's allies ... grumble that Manafort has spent a disproportionate amount of time on television - just as Trump himself has been avoiding the Sunday morning talk show circuit at Manafort's urging. 'I think it pisses him off that he was getting free television by going on the shows and now Paul Manafort is out there resurrecting his career,' said one campaign operative. Citing Manafort's advocacy ... for an expensive advertising push in upcoming states, the operative said Trump is 'saying I can get on every show I want for free and you're telling me not to do that and that I should pay for my advertising? That doesn't pass the smell test to me.'

"The mounting tension comes as Trump is struggling to incorporate traditional political tactics with the cult-of-personality approach that helped him climb from long shot to front-runner for the GOP nomination. In some ways, Manafort and Lewandowski represent the id and the ego of that balance, with the hardscrabble outsider Lewandowski earning Trump's trust early, only to be challenged by the more polished insider ... [C]ampaign insiders say it has become increasingly clear that Trump, for all his boasts about his ability to become more 'presidential,' is simply unwilling or perhaps unable to follow through, and resents efforts to transform him." With great backstory on Trump's New York
 victory speech http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=99a82374dbba75d01a331125b7586c8790183c00aa478ab480ca078c9e261dfc

--"Cruz-Kasich pact shows signs of strain ... Kasich refuses to say his supporters should vote for Cruz," by Nick Gass: "The deal started to come together as Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe and Kasich's chief strategist John Weaver touched base in person while attending last week's [RNC] spring meeting in Hollywood, Florida, and agreed to stay in touch, according to three sources briefed on the exchange. On Friday, they spoke by phone and agreed to make something happen - and that same day, Cruz aides were informed that a negotiation was in the works. ...

"At no point did Cruz or Kasich talk with each other about a prospective deal. On Monday morning, it didn't seem that Kasich was fully on board. ... 'I mean, everybody chill out.' Weaver quickly clarified ... in a tweet, ... 'We're not telling voters who to vote for in IN, only where we are going to spend resources to ultimately defeat Hillary. They get it.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=99a82374dbba75d08ef0663fcfe37acd9a49b15b937115bd6742e106c267ef55

JIM VANDEHEI proposes an Innovation Party in Wall Street Journal op-ed, "Bring on a Third-Party Candidate: Establishment America deserves disruption, but not of the Sanders or Trump type. Here's how to do it": "Trump's vulgar approach to politics is a terrific middle finger to the establishment but a terrible political and governing paradigm. Same goes for Sanders-style socialism. But if someone turned the critique, passion and disdain shared by the two movements into a new one, they could change the system in meaningful ways.

Through in-depth interviews, he takes a deeper look inside the health and wellness movement's people, companies and events - including New York Road Runners, Tough Mudder, CrossFit and Ironman - and at the traits and strategies driving their success.

WEEKEND WEDDINGS -- Janet Weinstein, a digital journalist at ABC News in Washington, marriedScott Simpson, co-founder at UbanStems, on April 9 in Lexington, Va. The two were surrounded by family and friends for the outdoor ceremony in the Appalachian Mountains at The Irvine Estate, with the wedding flowers provided and curated by UrbanStems. Many of the guests traveled as far as the UK (where the couple originally met and where the groom was born) for the occasion. Janet and Scott spent the last two weeks traveling in South Korea on honeymoon together - where the bride reports they visited museums, went to a fun baseball game (go Doosan Bears!), ate all the street food they could manage
 (including hot dogs coated in French fries), hiked on Jeju Island to work it off, then relaxed on the beach in Busan. Pic courtesy Anna Grace Photography http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=99a82374dbba75d01b77d104ef866fa41d4d16135852ed408bce1e365618163e

<b>TROUBLE IN TRUMP TOWER - &quot;Trump rejects new adviser's push to make him 'presidential':
</b>Frustrated with Manafort, the GOP front-runner shifts some power back to campaign manager Lewandowski,&quot; by Ken Vogel and Eli Stokols: &quot;Trump became upset late last week when he learned from media reports that Manafort privately told Republican leaders that the billionaire reality TV star was 'projecting an image' for voters and would begin toning down his rhetoric ... Trump also expressed concern about Manafort bringing several former lobbying colleagues into the campaign ... Now Trump is taking steps to return some authority to Manafort's chief internal rival, campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. ...</p><p><b>&quot;Lewandowski's allies
</b> ... grumble that Manafort has spent a disproportionate amount of time on television - just as Trump himself has been avoiding the Sunday morning talk show circuit at Manafort's urging. 'I think it pisses him off that he was getting free television by going on the shows and now Paul Manafort is out there resurrecting his career,' said one campaign operative. Citing Manafort's advocacy ... for an expensive advertising push in upcoming states, the operative said Trump is 'saying I can get on every show I want for free and you're telling me not to do that and that I should pay for my advertising? That doesn't pass the smell test to me.'</p><p><b>&quot;The mounting tension
</b> comes as Trump is struggling to incorporate traditional political tactics with the cult-of-personality approach that helped him climb from long shot to front-runner for the GOP nomination. In some ways, Manafort and Lewandowski represent the id and the ego of that balance, with the hardscrabble outsider Lewandowski earning Trump's trust early, only to be challenged by the more polished insider ... [C]ampaign insiders say it has become increasingly clear that Trump, for all his boasts about his ability to become more 'presidential,' is simply unwilling or perhaps unable to follow through, and resents efforts to transform him.&quot; <b>

In the last two months, I spoke with dozens of people in the national security realm-current and retired officers, veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and former White House, State Department, Pentagon and CIA officials. The words they used to describe their mood: Terrified. Shocked. Appalled. Never before, they say, has a candidate gotten so close to the White House with such little respect for the military.&quot;
