'IRISH WAKE': Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley's defunct presidential b=
id is hosting an "Irish wake" at an Irish pub on Wednesday to help pay off =
campaign debt. The announcement mistakenly said it was "Paid for and author=
ized by Bill<http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=3Dda6070f6727235ac2c7afa80f0fd=

enate," according to an O'Malley spokeswomen.

RAWA WATCH: The Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling has added Capitol Couns=
el to its roster of firms. Principals Aaron Cohen (former chief of staff to=
 former Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.)) and Drew Goesl (former chief of staff to=
 former Rep. Mike Ross (D-Ark.) and former communications director for form=
er Sen. Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.)) will follow the Restoration of America's =
Wire Act. The Sheldon Adelson-backed coalition, which spent $85,000 on lobb=
ying last quarter, also recently signed up The Keelen Group and terminated =
Squire Patton Boggs. Keelen and Capitol Counsel also lobby on RAWA for Adel=
son's Las Vegas Sands.

DRIVER'S SEAT: Venable's Chan Lieu, the former director of government affai=
rs, policy and strategic planning at the National Highway Traffic Safety Ad=
ministration, worked for Google last fall on the big highway funding bill t=
hat passed in December, H.R. 22. The registration<http://go.politicoemail.c=
om/?qs=3Dda6070f6727235ac9badf8a82a43de9561a88df8ddc49856c2a45451b441372a>,=
 effective Nov. 1, was posted last week. Lieu told PI he never went to the =
Hill but monitored the bill's implications for some of Google's projects, s=
uch as self-driving cars.

- Speaking of Google, the company's representatives met at the White House =
more than once a week on average from the beginning of Obama's presidency t=
hrough October 2015, The Intercept's David Dayen reported, drawing on data =
from the Campaign for Accountability. Almost 250 people have shifted from w=
orking in government service to working at Google or vice versa. Google's l=
obbyist, Johanna Shelton, visited the White House 128 times, more than twic=
e Microsoft's Fred Humphries or Comcast's David Cohen. Todd Park , the U.S.=
 chief technology officer, was the most-visited White House official, takin=
g meetings with Google representatives 22 times at the White House. The com=
pany, which spent almost nothing on lobbying before 2007, spent $16.7 milli=
on in 2015. http://bit.ly/1Soi5R4<http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=3Dda6070f=

DIGITS: McBee Strategic Consulting hired Garth Moore, who managed North Ame=
rican digital operations for Bono's ONE Campaign for five years. He'll run =
McBee's digital offerings, filling a hole at the firm that's been there sin=
ce its ownership shake-up a year and a half ago. Washington caught a glimps=
e of Moore's work earlier this month when the Bono presented multimedia ref=
ugee diaries<http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=3Dda6070f6727235acb0973d0a79fa=
8071058eae8067cf6d0a74ca82820fd3505b> alongside his testimony before the Se=
nate Appropriations Committee. Though today digital is part of the communic=
ations practice, Managing Director Eric Bovim envisions the possibility of =
having full-fledged digital clients in three years. Moore is McBee's second=
 recent hire (following Andrew Deerin, who made videos for Shakira and Paul=
 McCartney) who leans more toward Hollywood than the Beltway. As Bovim put =
it, "it's a content game now more than a messaging game."

STATE SPOTLIGHT: The pharmaceutical industry is fighting against a Californ=
ia ballot initiative that would lower drug prices in many cases, Pro Health=
 Care's Nancy Cook and Sarah Karlin-Smith report. The measure, which one Re=
publican lobbyist called a "grenade," would require the state to pay no mor=
e than the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for prescription drugs. Drug=
 companies are planning to spend $100 million to kill the referendum, and b=
rands like Johnson & Johnson, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Pfizer and Bayer have =
already raised about $67 million. The organization sponsoring the measure, =
the AIDS Health Care Foundation, has raised only $4.3 million in comparison=
. The drug industry has also been recruiting allies - roughly 30 groups, su=
ch as veterans' organizations, the California NAACP, The Bonnie J. Addario =
Lung Cancer Foundation, The Lupus Foundation of Southern California and the=
 California Chamber of Commerce, have signed on to oppose the measure on th=

a senator has been working for years to convince the Interior Department to=

geted at the Interior building during lunch hours. The smallest distance an=
 ad can be geo-targeted for is a 1-kilometer radius, and DOI takes up a sin=

<p><b>STATE SPOTLIGHT:</b> The pharmaceutical industry is fighting against =
a California ballot initiative that would lower drug prices in many cases, =
Pro Health Care's

one Republican lobbyist called a &quot;grenade,&quot; would require the sta=
te to pay no more than the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for prescrip=
tion drugs. Drug companies are planning to
 spend $100 million to kill the referendum, and brands like <b>Johnson &amp=

</b>and <b>Bayer </b>have already raised about $67 million. The organizatio=
n sponsoring the measure, the
<b>AIDS Health Care Foundation</b>, has raised only $4.3 million in compari=

 such as veterans' organizations, the<b> California NAACP, The Bonnie J. Ad=

 Lupus Foundation of Southern California </b>and the<b> California Chamber =
of Commerce</b>, have signed on to oppose the measure on the grounds it cou=
