A few extra notes about the North Portico greeting. President and FLOTUS =
were chatting in an animated fashion before and between the individual li=
mo arrivals, as if they were genuinely enjoying themselves. FLOTUS gown, =
already described by White House as ``blush -colored . . . designed by Na=
eem Khan,'' was off the shoulders, pretty impressive. (Pooler repeats den=
ial of any fashion cred). After the arrival of each limo, the Obamas gree=
ted each individual Nordic leader and spouse, then arranged themselves to=
 pose for pictures by the photogs on a riser opposite. A military escort =
then took each couple inside while the Obamas waited for the next limo to=
 arrive.

=20

Some housekeeping on tonight's dinner: The state dinner for the Nordic na=
tions prime ministers and president marks the administration's 12th ``Sta=
te or Official Visit'' dating back to November 2009 when the president ho=
sted a delegation from India.

Fortunately the weather has turned from overcast to clear, so the dinner =
is under tents on the South Lawn.

In a break from tradition, no table clothes and Nordic-style chairs _ whi=
ch, per Washington Post, the White House insists are not IKEA.

About 350 guests are there. Singer Demi Lovato is the scheduled entertain=
ment.

=20

Guest list for dinner includes most of the usual administration suspects =
(Josh Earnest seen in a dashing tux), plus a smattering of media, members=
 of Congress, business people and, of course, the delegations of the Nord=
ic nations. Vice President Biden is there with wife Dr. Jill Biden; Secre=
tary of State John Kerry also there.

Among the notables, per White House list:=20

Mr. Aziz Ansari, Actor & Comedian

            Ms. Fatima Ansari

Ms. Connie Britton, Actress

            Mr. Gregory Clark

Mr. Common, Rapper

Mr. Derek Dudley

Mr. Will Ferrell, Actor & Comedian

            Ms. Viveca Paulin

Mr. Lester Holt, Jr., NBC=20

            Mrs. Carol Hagen-Holt

Mr. Joel Kinnaman, Actor

            Ms. Cleo Wattenstrom

Mr. David Letterman, Television Host

Mrs. Regina Letterman

Ms. Demi Lovato, Singer=20

Mr. Michael Bayer

Mr. David Muir, ABC

            Ms. Patricia Mills

Mr. Al Roker, NBC=20

            Ms. Deborah Roberts

This is probably more than you want to know about the dinner, but in any =
case:

The dinner menu accentuates local ingredients - some of it from the White=
 House Kitchen Garden. In large measure it is meant to evoke the style an=
d spirit of Rene Redzepi of the world-famous Noma in Copenhagen.

Per the White House, the first course is Atlantic tuna, salt-cured, then =
lightly dressed with California olive oil and tossed with spring onion, t=
arragon, and chives from the White House Kitchen Garden. The second cours=
e is a tomato tartare served alongside diced citrus fillets and garnished=
 with White House Kitchen Garden micro lettuces. The main course is tende=
r beef short ribs from Nebraska. The meat is brined in red wine, herbs, a=
nd aromatics for two days, then slow braised for eight hours. It is serve=
d with hot kale salad and creamy lemon thyme dumplings.=20

For dessert, each table sports a handcrafted fishing boat made of gum pas=
te and chocolate. These showpieces, topped with a display of all five Nor=
dic flags and the American flag, are intended to celebrate the many speci=
es of fish living in surrounding waters. Additionally, sweet miniature pa=
stries, including raspberry kringle, elderberry custard pie, ginger goose=
berry cookies, strawberry rhubarb tarts, and red currant chocolates will =
be served. Each guest will also be served a caramel almond mille feuille =
with multiple layers of flaky pastry, salted almonds, apples slow roasted=
 in White House Honey Ale, and finished with vanilla bean Chantilly and l=
ingonberry cream. This dessert is accompanied by strawberries, raspberrie=
s, and black mission figs with fresh lemon verbena and mint glaze from th=
e White House Kitchen Garden.=20
