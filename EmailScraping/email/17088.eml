Friend --

As Democrats, we believe that no one who works hard every
day should have to live in poverty because they're paid a
minimum wage that's too low. We know that climate change is
a challenge we must confront. We believe no young person
should have to spend so much on a college education that
they end up shackled by years of debt.

And we know that we can never, never allow Donald Trump to
become President of the United States.

Will you donate $3 or more today to help keep that from happening
and to elect Democrats who will fight for everything we believe in?

https://my.democrats.org/Stop-Donald-Trump

Any Republican president would put President Obama's
progress on economic security in danger, make moves to
repeal health care reform that millions of Americans are now
relying on, and try to move backwards on the steps we've
taken these past seven years to make our country more equal
and more fair.

But it's clear that Trump -- with his repugnant attitude
toward women, immigrants, Muslim-Americans, and pretty much
anyone he comes across -- is the worst of the bunch.

We're going to be going up against him this fall. So right
now, I'm asking you to pitch in $3 or whatever you can so
that we can stop Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans:

https://my.democrats.org/Stop-Donald-Trump

Thank you.

Hillary
