BREAKING: BERNIE SANDERS has accepted a Fox News invitation to debate one more time before California's June 7 primary, POLITICO's Hadas Gold reports. Over to you HILLARY CLINTON. More here: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=6ec5e42ab0e32204b07e3fbb612a9f122f57431406e2ea13d6fc4e100b7145a2 

IS THIS BERNING AN ETERNAL FLAME: A call for cooler heads in the Democratic party has led, instead, to an escalating flame war. And BERNIE SANDERS' campaign and the Democratic National Committee appear no closer to toning things down. 

Sanders' campaign today blamed DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz's failed leadership for a rift, POLITICO's Nolan D. McCaskill reports. The latest fight comes after chaos at Saturday's state convention in Nevada, where Sanders loyalists believe delegate allocations were done unfairly.

After Wasserman Schultz called for Sanders to denounce the demonstrations, his campaign responded by accusing her of "throwing shade." And Sanders camp fired back at Wasserman Schultz on Wednesday morning after the Democratic National Committee chairwoman panned the campaign's "anything but acceptable" response to reports of violence and threats from Sanders supporters at the Nevada Democratic convention over the weekend. 

Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, pointedly accused Wasserman Schultz of undermining the Sanders campaign from the get-go and called into question her leadership. "He categorically condemns any kind of threats that went on - absolutely unacceptable," Weaver told CNN today before accusing Wasserman Schultz of "throwing shade on the Sanders campaign since the very beginning." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a16212e4911168ccf3f4f301f41c3b7513ad2826e1953a3f5ea4e98a7dac0b98 

Happy Wednesday. Whoa, we're half way there. Whoa-oh, 2016 Blast-ing on a prayer ... http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=256edb3cfb74daf958df9603ee757b78ab49726d175f87d0a53cfd89bd0732c4 Henry C. Jackson (@henrycjjackson) is here to guide you through the day's campaign news, so send your tips, complaints and thoughts on whether it makes a difference if we make it or not to: hjackson@politico.com. 

2) SUPREME LIST: DONALD TRUMP released a list of 11 judges he'd consider for Supreme Court appointments, POLITICO's Nick Gass reports. It's a virtually unprecedented move that's meant to telegraph his conservative credentials. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=93a7df93a9a4426eb66e00a3eed25bcf90cad815f2d8aa304af6889885efa6ea The prospective candidates are a mix of Bush appointees to federal courts and state Supreme Court justices - a, dare we say, somewhat conventional list for a Republican candidate. It was sufficiently conventional that the White House's immediate attack - that Democrats were unlikely to vote for any of the judges suggested - felt like a debate from a quieter, almost pre-Trump era. 
http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=517ed205245255b67b9b846681273454309ac579f4609b599667ee454611a9f1 

BLAST NOTE: When was the last time any candidate gave you names of Supreme Court candidates?

3) MEASURING UP: It's hard to figure out how much DONALD TRUMP is actually worth. POLITICO's Shane Goldmacher reports Trump's second financial disclosure document is so long and his holdings so vast and byzantine that it's impossible to measure in specifics. That, combined with the Federal Election Commission's vague disclosure requirements, means that it's impossible to verify what Trump says he's worth: about $557 million a year in income and $10 billion in net worth. But the documentation does shed some light on his holdings and debts, which include loans for renovation project on an old post office in Washington, D.C., and blue-chip companies like Google. 
http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4000e7e22296ac3083ba9f059dfbd16567e4862e7ee32911102d81073912dc68 

3) SLOUCHING TO PHILADELPHIA: HILLARY CLINTON won last night! But, yeah. A razor-thin win in Kentucky and a lopsided loss in Oregon to BERNIE SANDERS hardly showcased the confident strut of a Democratic nominee in waiting. It as a margin so thin, in fact, DONALD TRUMP could troll it. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=554e4e8257b7f109f952dd70cf11d1a4543bcdb07ffd87ce806a311b130293dc POLITICO's Gabriel Debenedetti reports that her win, while keeping her from get blanked in the month of May, offered little else than that - a win. There's still no sign that the party is unifying (if anything the opposite). And now, Clinton will basically go dark for a bit before more primaries in June: she has few public events and several fundraisers planned. 
http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=af539f7229b2063724bb4a8192cb32ee6099da98886713bc5fce76e52d655c49 The other macro problem for Clinton's campaign is how to deal with Trump. As POLITICO's Annie Karni reports, her campaign has tried out an array of attacks. But it's harder than it looks. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a9efd59bb36ea474cef98f7f36fa7b834d0b64225cf2897d031bb41bd7b51dfd 

5) LIKE FRANKIE SAID I DID IT MY WAY: What did we say about DONALD TRUMP doing things a new way? POLITICO's Eli Stokols and Hadas Gold look at how Trump is redefining the Republican National Convention. And they find the candidate is unusually involved, micromanaging everything from speaking slots to what prime time moments will look like. And he is weighing up some high drama: Perhaps waiting until the RNC in Cleveland to reveal his running mate or even rolling out his cabinet during the festivities. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=47d374aee7ea144a0a2cddc421b49a08063fdc5858004adf4ddaa4839de5b6a5  

TRAIL MIX: Elsewhere on the campaign trail, HILLARY CLINTON out-earns DONALD TRUMP, but she's having a rough day on the Internet. Trump isn't seeing gentrification in Oakland. A Jersey man wins a fight and a woman uses her obituary for a sick burn. 

TRUMPED BY HER: HILLARY CLINTON's speaking fees were generally about twice as much as DONALD TRUMP's. (Yahoo!) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=17e459a54f279aa7e56fd56679a0b9a8d0c9d2b88404ec9c536f2487b1026865 

VIRAL PROBLEM: A video that highlights HILLARY CLINTON's shifting views is going viral. (The Washington Post). http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=0c7b96ec23c7523dadcaf5003a6cac72644d5079dd0a0922ac6d96c77f5fdfb5 

OVER THE LINE: Some of the voicemails left by BERNIE SANDERS supporters for the Nevada Democratic Party chairwoman are pretty aggressive. (Mediaite) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e5835d637c0579c034e894172ceebb2b9d6bb799cb67840e56568fef3a5f41e0 

LIKE BAGHDAD, ONLY MORE SO: DONALD TRUMP said Ferguson, Mo., and Oakland, Calif., were among the most dangerous places in the world. (The Washington Post) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=b95875f490801cbfd6f246a4cfa8bb74a048b49721d245fa2d3118da1f2a1130 

KELLY FILED: Esquire thinks DONALD TRUMP got the best of Megyn Kelly in their interview special last night. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=61579045b237a14478d6b0eb587aed432ceabefbf59bb82488c811c8fe36c25a More on that here: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=437ab0566d37d4d2ea8328e0ecb33f06be16a2c97aed7a70889034a59f288d34 

KISS AND TELL: DONALD TRUMP meets with former Secretary of State and GOP eminence grise Henry Kissinger today. (CBS) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2e186c379d6ebc32ff0934678ce89a6b7f4fc2dde38a7af45a17ded6b1276c58 

GARDEN STATEMENT: A New Jersey man won a fight to fly a DONALD TRUMP flag. (NJ.com) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=da50003ee8bdd960fe6fc7297c3a453b16e657f601c3509ead139d655962327f 

'ETERNAL' FLAME: A woman used her obituary to say she chose God's eternal embrace over choosing between HILLARY CLINTON and DONALD TRUMP. (Time) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e284b67fb2724f8801c07fd97b929170c81d18924e1d77d5cbeed124b4e2ab58 

WHAT'S NEXT: BERNIE SANDERS is in northern California today. But we're in a primary lull: No more voting until June. 

THEY SAID IT: "He's not a groper." -Ivanka Trump, on her dad, DONALD TRUMP. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5da50ec0d2af8a071acd79e4d056af9818831d70a9d292a934364e6efcc6e8f9 

MAGIC NUMBER: 49.3 million. That's how much DONALD TRUMP sold the Miss Universe Pageant for last year. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9f4ac26f67ba6080a59499d36f2077fe47688bb82d3efaab443ad667bdec533a
