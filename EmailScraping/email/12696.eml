*=E2=80=8BRisky, Divisive & Unpredictable: Republicans Continue to Reject A
Potential Trump Presidency*

Another day, another Republican rejects Donald Trump's unpredictable, risky
and divisive candidacy. What else is new? Donald Trump has for years proven
himself to be a loose cannon whose hateful language and dangerous policies
will do serious harm to working families and put America=E2=80=99s security=
 at
risk, and Republicans are continuing to acknowledge that a President Trump
would be too big a risk.

*Read the growing list
<https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/updates/2016/05/04/conservatives-r=
ebuke-trump-as-he-captures-republican-nomination/>
of Republicans unwilling to support a President Donald Trump and fresh
condemnations of Trump:*

: "And it's not just -- it's not just me, but I think there are millions of
soccer moms, football dads, baseball dads across America, and they're
trying to raise their children in a tough culture.  And here they have a
presidential candidate who is demeaning the women, he's vulgar, he's crass,
I don't know where they're going to go. [=E2=80=A6] Again, I have a nine-ye=
ar-old
and he can't even listen to the guy on television.  How will he bridge that
gap?"

*Speaker Paul Ryan [R-WI]

mp-in-speech-to-wisconsin-gop-convention-b99725376z1-379528591.html>:
*"U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan of Janesville remained unwilling Saturday to
say if he would endorse Trump."


*AP: Donald who? Wisconsin Republicans avoid talking Trump
<http://www.startribune.com/donald-who-wisconsin-republicans-avoid-talking-=
trump/379530061/>*:
"Mixed feelings about presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald
Trump were on full display Saturday at the Wisconsin GOP convention, with
Gov. Scott Walker and other officeholders not even speaking his name."

*Robert Gates, Former U.S. Secretary of Defense
<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-transcripts-may-15-2016-priebu=
s-gates-king-blackburn-collins/>*:
"Well, I have some real issues with things he said about national security
policy and some concerns. I think there are some contradictions. You can't
have a trade war with China and then turn around and ask them to help you
on North Korea. I have no idea what his policy would be in terms of dealing
with ISIS. I worry a little bit about his admiration for Vladimir Putin."

*Rep. Tom Cole [R-OK]
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-reince-priebus-sen-jeff-ses=
sions/story?id=3D39116794>*:
"Over the course of the campaign, he's already said some things that he
ought to regret. And I think he will regret politically=E2=80=A6"

*Conservative columnist George Will
<http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/05/15/reince-priebus-reacts-to-ques=

"The interesting thing is the mating dance between Donald Trump and Paul
Ryan. In a statement issued after their meeting, but I=E2=80=99ll bet dolla=
rs to
doughnuts written before the meeting, they refer to our few differences,
they spoke of our many important areas of common ground and urged
Republicans to unite around our shared principles, to which one response is
name one, one shared principle."

*Even Trump's supporters have some concerns:*

*Rep. Peter King [R-NY]
<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-transcripts-may-15-2016-priebu=
s-gates-king-blackburn-collins/>*:
"I still have real questions with him as far as national security. I don't
think his Asian policy is coherent, because, again, if he does want to get
in a trade war with China, he has to explain how that coincides with him
wanting to use China against North Korea. If he wants to have leverage over
China, how can he be talking about taking troops out of Japan and Korea?"
