Moderate Marco? Rubio Wants to Undo Gay Marriage, End Obama=92s LGBT Protec=
tions<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/12/10/moderate-marco-rubio=
-wants-to-undo-gay-marriage-end-obama-s-lgbt-protections.html>
DAILY BEAST // JAY MICHAELSON

In an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, the Republican shr=
eds his newfound centrist image.

The conventional wisdom is that Marco Rubio is the moderate alternative to =
Ted Cruz and Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.

But when it comes to LGBT equality, Rubio is as extreme as anyone. In less =
than three minutes on the Christian Broadcasting Network<mailto:http://blog=
s.cbn.com/thebrodyfile/archive/2015/12/05/brody-file-exclusive-marco-rubio-=
would-reverse-obamas-gender-identity.aspx>, the up-and-coming candidate sai=
d he would reverse President Obama=92s executive orders on LGBT nondiscrimi=
nation, appoint judges to roll back abortion and same-sex marriage, and exp=
and religious exemptions to a wide range of laws.

Most surprisingly, Rubio told CBN that he would =93reverse the executive or=
ders the president has made=94 on LGBT nondiscrimination, which a large maj=
ority of Americans support.

While saying that, Rubio repeated the lie that schools have =93been forced =
to, you know, provide girls access to a boys=92 bathroom and so forth.=94 T=
his calumny, used to great effect in the recent debate over a civil-rights =
ordinance in Houston, is totally false.

What is true is that, in places where gender identity is protected by law, =
public institutions must allow transgender people to use gender-appropriate=
 restrooms. Not =93girls=94=97transgender men, who may have more facial hai=
r than Rubio does, and who no one in their right mind would want using a gi=
rls=92 restroom.

Wait a minute! Not only has Rubio misstated the law, there are no executive=
 orders that require this at all. What Obama has ordered is that government=
 contractors should not be allowed to discriminate when they=92re getting g=
overnment money. That=92s not about bathrooms; it=92s about whether a busin=
ess can fire gay and trans people for being gay or trans, while taking taxp=
ayer money. So, Rubio=92s not even telling the right lie.

The way Rubio put it, =93there are many government contractors and small co=
mpanies who provide services to the government who are faith-based people, =
and they are, they are being compelled to sin by government in their busine=
ss conduct.=94

That=92s an interesting argument, first made by some Christians in the Bibl=
e. Jesus rejected it, saying they should =93render unto Caesar what is Caes=
ar=92s, and render unto God what is God=92s.=94 In other words, if you ente=
r the marketplace=97let alone do business with the government=97you have to=
 play by the same rules as everyone else. That=92s not a sin, that=92s what=
 Jesus said to do.

Rubio also took a hard line on the issue of religious exemptions. In additi=
on to exempting churches, religious organizations, and religiously affiliat=
ed organizations, Rubio said he would =93ensure people in the private secto=
r and the not-for-profit sector are being protected in living out their fai=
th.=94

Those are nice words, but in practice, they would mean significantly expand=
ed special rights for anyone who believes they should be exempt from the la=
w. We=92ve already seen how this plays out: men accused of abusing their wi=
ves have said they shouldn=92t be prosecuted, because the Bible tells them =
so; doctors refused to treat the children of same-sex couples; pharmacists =
have refused to fill prescriptions. Plus, corporations have refused to prov=
ide health-care coverage for contraception to women, or any coverage at all=
 to the legally married same-sex spouses of employees.

Indeed, in a case now before the Supreme Court, one religious organization =
has refused even to check =93no=94 on the government form regarding health =
insurance. Even saying no, they say, is too much a burden on their religion=
.

Rubio would protect all of this. Not just the Kim Davises of the world who =
want to opt out of doing their government jobs. Not just Catholic Charities=
, which takes government money to do adoption services but then refuses to =
place children with gay parents. But anyone in the private sector who says =
that child-labor laws, domestic-violence laws, or nondiscrimination laws do=
n=92t apply to them.

Third, Rubio confirmed that =93one of the biggest things the next president=
 is going to do is appoint justices to the Supreme Court.=94 In an Orwellia=
n turn of phrase, Rubio used progressive rhetoric=97=93the Constitution is =
a living and breathing document=94=97to support a long-held conservative po=
sition, that =93it=92s supposed to be interpreted and applied based on its =
original intent.=94

In case that wasn=92t clear enough, Rubio spelled it out. =93There is no wa=
y that you can read that Constitution and deduce from it that there is a co=
nstitutional right to an abortion, or a constitutional right to marry someo=
ne of the same sex=85.  So you need judges that understand how constitution=
ally flawed that those two kinds of rulings and others have been.=94 In oth=
er words, Rubio would appoint justices who would overrule Roe v. Wade and O=
bergefell v. Hodges, which struck down all bans on same-sex marriage. The s=
upposedly sane candidate wants to void marriages; allow states to ban all a=
bortions of any kind; and turn back the clock for women and gays.

Of course, if the Constitution really is a =93living and breathing document=
,=94 then it=92s easy to deduce the rights which Rubio ridicules. The Const=
itution provides equal protection of the laws; that means that gay people, =
as well as straight people, have the right to marry. The Constitution also =
provides the right of due process, but when it comes to a woman=92s body, t=
here is no due process that could justify controlling her uterus and forcin=
g her to remain pregnant. These issues may not have been understood in 1868=
, but that=92s the point of having a =93living and breathing document.=94 I=
t didn=92t freeze to death 150 years ago.

Rubio=92s positions are no different from those of Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee,=
 and other candidates on the right=97and that=92s precisely the point. Whil=
e successfully positioning himself as the alternative to the far right, Rub=
io has adopted positions identical to it.
