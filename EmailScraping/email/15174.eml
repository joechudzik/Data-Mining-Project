DEBATE FACT CHECK: Republican Trickle-Down Tax Policies Fail the Middle Cla=
ss



Republicans are now at the point in the evening where they tout their tax p=

instead of looking out for middle and working class Americans.



Republicans continue to push for the same failed tax policies the prioritiz=
e those at the very top.  These tired trickle-down policies that Americans =
continue to reject make it clear that Republicans will not fight for hardwo=
rking Americans.

RAND PAUL THINKS WE NEED TO LOWER TAXES ON THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS IF WE W=
ANT THEM TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE, SO HE PROPOSED A PLAN THAT DID SO



Rand Paul: If The President "Wants A More Fair And Balanced Income Tax, He'=

ND PAUL: "You know, we are at a point where if you get too many people rece=

hey're not really -- they don't have skin in the game. And I am afraid they=
 -- the system may slip away from us. And the president referred to this a =
couple of times. But he doesn't quite understand or acknowledged that when =
he says the rich need to pay their fair share, that 10 percent -- the top 1=
0 percent of wage earners pay 70 percent of the income tax. So if wants a m=

cally for the upper income folks, because they are paying all of the income=
 tax right now." [Stossel, Fox Business, 1/24/12]
