DNC Statement on Nevada Democratic Party Letter

WASHINGTON =96 DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz today issued the fol=
lowing statement on a letter from the Nevada Democratic Party regarding thr=
eatening and violent behavior among some participants around their state pa=
rty convention this weekend:



=93We are deeply concerned about the troubling details laid out in the lett=

hip of both of our campaigns to ask them to stand with the Democratic Party=
 in denouncing the type of behavior on display over the weekend in Las Vega=

they must be addressed in an orderly, civil and peaceful manner.

 been in place for decades and the specific procedures for this cycle were =
agreed upon in 2014. In Nevada on Saturday, the state party=92s credentials=
 committee was made up of an equal number of members representing both camp=
aigns. That=92s a testament to our party=92s fundamental belief in being in=
clusive, open to the public, and transparent. The process for nominating a =
Democratic Presidential candidate is not something taken lightly, it is a f=
