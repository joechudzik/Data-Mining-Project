SL: That Didn't Take Long: Latest Anti-Trump Effort Quickly Falls Apart
With Donald Trump's recent sweeping victories, it's clear he's the only candidate that can win the Republican nomination. As a result, the GOP remains in chaos and recent developments mean that things won't be getting any better.

Last night, Ted Cruz and John Kasich announced they had entered an unusual agreement<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/04/24/cruz-and-kasich-devise-strategy-to-divide-up-three-primary-states/> to save their failing campaigns - dividing their efforts in states with upcoming primaries to stop Trump from clinching more victories.  Cruz would focus on Indiana and Kasich would ramp up his efforts in Oregon and New Mexico. Of course, it's too little, too late.

Now, less than 24 hours later, the agreement is already falling apart. Today Kasich said<http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/24/politics/ted-cruz-john-kasich-join-forces-to-stop-donald-trump/>:
... he still wants Indiana voters to support him. "They ought to vote for me," he said during a gaggle with reporters at a Philadelphia diner. "I'm not campaigning in Indiana and he's not campaigning in these other states, that's all. It's not a big deal," Kasich said.

"Wow, that didn't take long. Cruz and Kasich's desperate attempt to stay relevant - despite the fact they  mathematically have no chance of winning the nomination without plunging their party into further chaos - has already fallen apart. The GOP is still in denial - Trump hasn't taken over the party, their leadership over the years has promoted the divisive policies that allowed Trump to flourish." - DNC National Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach
