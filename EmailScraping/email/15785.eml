For Immediate Release
April 21, 2016

Contact: DNC Press =96 202-863-8148

Excerpts from the DNC Press Call on the GOP=92s Full-scale Florida Freak-ou=
t

Today, DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Florida Representative T=
ed Deutch hosted a press call to discuss the mad scramble happening in Flor=
ida this week over the Republican National Committee=92s convention rules. =
With Donald Trump=92s sweeping victory in the New York primary, it=92s clea=
r he=92s the only candidate that can win a majority of first-ballot delegat=
es. With the hopes of saving their own flagging campaigns, Ted Cruz and Joh=
n Kasich frantically flew to Florida to try to convince party insiders to b=
lock Trump =96 the candidate with the most votes and most delegates =96 fro=
m winning the nomination.

The contrast between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party couldn=
=92t be more clear. Following the New York primary, exit polling showed 68 =
percent of Democratic voters felt their primary had energized the party, wh=
ile 57 percent of Republican voters said their primary had divided the part=
y. With Republicans all over the map pledging to skip this summer=92s Repub=
lican Convention, it=92s clear the GOP is in a full-scale freak-out.

Below find excerpts from the call as prepared for delivery:

DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz:
=85
=93As you know, on Tuesday evening, Donald Trump scored a landslide victory=
 in New York, and is now the only candidate who can win the nomination on t=
he first ballot. Right now, the RNC is having its spring meeting in South F=
lorida, trying to figure out how to prevent that from happening. John Kasic=
h and Ted Cruz, who have been essentially eliminated from contention on the=
 first ballot, rushed down to South Florida to save their own campaigns but=
 only by stopping Trump. It's been somewhat amusing to watch Republicans tr=
y to distance themselves from their presumptive nominee. But the Republican=
 Party just doesn=92t get it. Donald Trump is the face of the GOP. His offe=
nsive, divisive, misogynistic campaign is deeply ingrained within the Party=
, it's their M.O.

Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich are both playing the same da=
ngerous game as Trump. They've made it clear they're not any more intereste=
d in substance than him, just broken government that limits rights, as oppo=
sed to protecting them. Both of them rushed to Florida last night to meet w=
ith Republican leaders at the RNC meeting. Cruz is hoping against hope for =
a brokered convention given that he couldn=92t win the nomination outright,=
 and Kasich=92s decision to stay in the race despite no clear path to the n=
omination is a fool's errand. He claims that he can beat the Democratic nom=
inee in a general election, yet he hasn't been able to win anything but his=
 own state in his own party.

I am confident that Democrats will have the strongest possible candidate co=
me November. We=92re also poised to reclaim the Senate and pick up more sea=
ts in the House. It=92s because we offer the Americans a clear choice =96 w=
e are offering a forward looking vision to keep our nation moving forward a=
nd build on the progress we've made under Democratic leadership. Under Pres=
ident Obama=92s leadership we have witnessed 73 straight months of private =
sector job growth that created 14.4 million new jobs.
=85

As the DNC Chair, I am proud of the success the Democratic candidates vying=
 for nomination. We have much to be proud of. But it=92s clear that Republi=
cans are gearing up for a messy, prolonged fight for their presidential nom=
ination. I wish them luck, but this is a mess of their own making.=94

Representative Ted Deutch:

=93You know =96 one of the biggest misconceptions about this campaign is th=
at Donald Trump is an outsider who has taken over the Republican party. He =
is no such thing =96 he is the logical extension of their divisive, do-noth=
ing politics that we=92ve been seeing on Capitol Hill for years. Instead of=
 helping Democrats rescue the economy and the auto industry, Republicans tr=
ied to block it. Instead working with Democrats to craft a law that has giv=
en 20 million Americans health insurance, Republicans tried to block it, an=
d have voted to repeal it over 60 times. Instead of doing their jobs and pa=
ssing a budget, Speaker Ryan has abdicated his responsibility. And over in =
the Senate, Republicans are refusing to do their jobs, and are holding up a=
 Supreme Court nomination for supposed political gain.

Neither Debbie nor I came to Congress to do nothing. We came to get things =
done for the people we represent. The Democrats want to work together. We w=
ant to take on the challenges that our nation faces but we need a willing p=
artner to do it.
=85

It=92s no surprise that so many of my Republican colleagues are choosing to=
 sit out the Republican Convention in Cleveland because they want to distan=
ce themselves from Trump too. Former GOP nominee John McCain, former Republ=
ican frontrunner Jeb Bush, and countless others have said they will skip th=
e convention. Even Ohio=92s Republican Senator Rob Portman said he may not =
go to Cleveland for the convention that is happening in his own state.

By contrast, Democrats are fired up about our candidates, and we=92re motiv=
ated to build on the progress of the past seven years, and keep divisive de=
magogues like Donald Trump out of the White House. Holding elected office =
=96 from the city council to the presidency of the United States =96 is a p=
ublic service. Debbie and I take our positions very seriously. We were elec=
ted to serve not only our constituents, but also our nation. I am calling o=
n Republicans to get serious about leading. I am calling on them to serve o=
ur nation with honor and distinction, not the slugfest we=92ve witnessed th=
us far.=94
