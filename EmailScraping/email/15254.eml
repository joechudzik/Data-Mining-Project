=A0

Vice President Biden spoke to the White House=92s Gun Violence Prevention=
 Convening for State and Local Officials.=A0

=A0

No news, but here are some highlights from his remarks.=A0

=A0

Pool was led into a room in the EEOB at 3:22 p.m., which was filled with =
about 100 people waiting for the VP to speak.=A0

=A0

Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), who leads the House gun violence preventio=
n task force, served as an impromptu hype man, warming up the crowd for t=
he VP who was running late.=A0

=A0

Biden entered the room at 3:34 p.m. to a standing ovation.=A0

=A0

Connecticut Gov. Daniel Malloy (D) introduced him. He praised President O=
bama and Biden for =93reigniting=94 a previously dormant national convers=
ation on gun violence, adding that =93no one has more credibility on this=
 issue than Vice President Biden.=94

=A0

Biden drew laughs when let the crowd know he would be veering off-script =
from his prepared remarks. =93I=92m not going to go through what they=92v=
e prepared for me here, which is good.=94=A0

=A0

=93We know that gun violence is ravaging our communities,=94 said Biden. =
=93Of all the civilized countries in the world, this is an exception. It =
doesn=92t have to be this way. There is no reason for it to be this way.=94=
=A0

=A0

He praised state and local leaders for =93taking some real chances, takin=
g some real hits=94 in passing gun laws of their own and he urged them no=
t to lose hope over congressional inaction on federal background check le=
gislation.=A0

=A0

Biden said =93it took a hell of a long time=94 to pass the last major fed=
eral gun-control bill in the early 1990s.=A0

=A0

=93I don=92t know anything that=92s difficult that comes quickly.=94

=A0

He talked up Obama administration executive actions to strengthen the bac=
kground check process.=A0

=A0

But he also urged officials across the country to take action if their st=
ates don=92t report information to the National Instant Criminal Backgrou=
nd Check System.=A0

=A0

=93You guys can make a big difference back home,=94 he said. =93We can sa=
ve lives.=94

=A0

He suggested the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech could have been prevented=
 if the background check system had more information at its disposal.

=A0

=93There=92s going to be, and there has been, another Virginia Tech, wher=
e you=92ve got a guy who, if they had just reported this information to t=
he NICS system, there would be half a dozen people still alive,=94 Biden =
said. =93It really matters.=94

=A0

Biden also lashed out at gun-rights groups like the National Rifle Associ=
ation for putting pressure on gun manufacturers and sellers against so-ca=
lled =93smart gun=94 technology.

=A0

=93It=92s amazing how the NRA and some gun-owner organizations have gone =
ballistic, no pun intended, about the notion we should be looking at safe=
 gun technology.=94=A0

=A0

Biden said the administration is not trying to undermine the Second Amend=
ment, but stressed that more can be done legally to prevent gun violence.=
=A0

=A0

=93Whether you all like it or not, there is a Second Amendment. It is rea=
l. It exists and it must be upheld,=94 he said.=A0

=A0

Biden said that congressional dysfunction has reached unprecedented level=
s =93in modern history, short of the Civil War,=94 meaning that =93we=92r=
e probably not going to get much more done in the next nine months=94 on =
gun control.=A0

=A0

But he urged state and local officials to continue to pursue new gun cont=
rol measures on their own.

=A0

=93It matters. It has a cumulative impact,=94 he said. =93It=92s a long w=
ay of saying, =91don=92t quit on this.=92=94

=A0

The VP finished his remarks at 4:11 p.m., drawing another standing ovatio=
n.=A0

=A0

He stepped away from the podium and mingled with audience members in the =
front row, but his remarks were not audible to the pool in the back of th=
e room.=A0

=A0

A minute later, Biden declared =93I=92m outta here!=94 and left the room.=
