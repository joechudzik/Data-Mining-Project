Trump at War<http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/trump-at-war/>

By Andy Kroll

=85



Meanwhile, when Trump has weighed in on national security questions, his re=
marks often reveal either ignorance or disdain for military expertise and t=
he codes of conduct that govern the armed forces. =93I know more about ISIS=
 than the generals do. Believe me,=94 he boasted in one speech, adding, "I=
=92ve had a lot of wars of my own. I=92m really good at war." His foreign p=
olicy prescriptions include proposals to =93bomb the shit out of ISIS,=94 t=
o =93take out=94 the families of ISIS members and to torture terrorism susp=
ects. (=93Would I approve waterboarding? You bet your ass I would,=94 he to=
ld one crowd. =93And you know what? If it doesn't work, they deserve it any=
way, for what they're doing.=94) When it was pointed out that soldiers coul=
dn=92t legally carry out those last two actions, Trump was unconcerned. "Th=
ey're not going to refuse me. Believe me.=94 (He walked back that last stat=
ement the next day.) The Geneva Conventions, he recently observed, have mad=
e American soldiers =93afraid to fight.=94



Trump=92s pronouncements on foreign policy, combined with his years of broa=
dsides, have set off a very real fear within military circles about what mi=
ght happen were he to become president. In the last two months, I spoke wit=
h dozens of people in the national security realm=97current and retired off=
icers, veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and former White House=
, State Department, Pentagon and CIA officials. The words they used to desc=
ribe their mood: Terrified. Shocked. Appalled. Never before, they say, has =
a candidate gotten so close to the White House with such little respect for=
 the military.



=93He completely misunderstands the military profession that he would head =
if he were the president,=94 said Robert Killebrew, a retired colonel who s=
erved in the Army for more than 30 years. Others were less polite. In a pai=
r of ads produced by the American Future Fund, a retired Special Forces com=
mander named Michael Waltz calls Trump a draft-dodger who =93hasn=92t serve=
d this country a day in his life,=94 and a Vietnam veteran, Tom Hanton, say=
s that Trump=92s quip about POWs was =93the most infuriating comment I thin=
k I=92ve heard from a politician in my entire life.=94 One former Marine in=
fantry officer described Trump to me as a =93fake-bake-ing chicken hawk=94 =
whose =93knowledge of the Middle East could be trumped (sorry) by your aver=
age Georgetown sophomore.=94



Trump=92s chosen foreign policy advisers=97which include a 2009 college gra=
duate who touted his experience in the Model U.N. on his online r=E9sum=E9 =
and another who used Kanye West lyrics to make arguments on his foreign pol=
icy blog=97have only stoked these anxieties. =93Weirdo nobodies,=94 was how=
 one military historian characterized them to me. =93They=92re probably the=
 least qualified group of foreign policy and national security advisers I=
=92ve ever seen or even heard of,=94 said Richard Kohn, an expert in civil-=
military relations and retired professor at the University of North Carolin=
a.

=85



For even the savviest of presidents, the relationship between a commander i=
n chief and his military is famously fraught, an intricate dance of egos an=
d agendas, worldviews and bureaucracies. A President Trump, however, could =
usher in a clash of historic proportions. =93If you take the man at his wor=
d,=94 said Michael Breen, the president of the Truman National Security Pro=
ject and a decorated former Army officer, =93we have a presidential candida=
te who seems to have committed himself to triggering what would probably be=
 the greatest crisis in civil-military relations since the American Civil W=
ar.=94

=85



The current Joint Chiefs chairman, Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, is =
known as an especially skillful operator able to bridge the diplomatic and =
military worlds, with a low-key demeanor that helped to win over Obama. And=
 in recent months, Dunford has found subtle ways to signal disapproval of T=
rump=92s statements. When he was asked during a Senate Armed Services Commi=
ttee hearing about Trump=92s support for torture and attacking the families=
 of suspected terrorists, Dunford didn=92t mention Trump by name, but obser=
ved that such orders would have an =93adverse effect=94 on =93the morale of=
 the force=94 and =93aren=92t legal for them to do anyway.=94

=85



The nation=92s intelligence agencies have also been gripped by similar anxi=
eties about the prospect of a Trump presidency. CIA Director John Brennan r=
ecently told NBC News that he would refuse to execute orders from a future =
president to use waterboarding. John Rizzo, the former CIA general counsel =
who worked at the agency for 35 years, told me that the employees he still =
spoke with were =93terrified=94 at the prospect of reopening the debates ov=
er the use of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques. =93De=
ep concern is a mild way of putting the prospect of their commander in chie=
f basically ordering them to go down this road again given all the trauma,=
=94 he said. If Trump won and followed through on his proposals, Rizzo pred=
icted an employee =93exodus.=94 =93At a minimum,=94 he went on, =93people w=
ould refuse to participate in anything resembling the former interrogation =
program and insist on a transfer to another part of the agency where they w=
ouldn=92t be involved in these things.=94
