can you follow up (without me on it) and say "Thank you so much for
agreeing to contribute to Ken's event with President Obama" and give him
the link? Here's who it should go to:

to: jgural@ngkf.com

I was invited to a roundtable with him before your event which sounds more
interesting =E2=80=93 plus free.  Not sure yet but you can count on $10,000=
 from
me.  Glad to see you got Obama and I only get Biden plus you have a nicer
apartment and cheap office space plus the Mets.
