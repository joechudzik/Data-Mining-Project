For Immediate Release May 7, 2016





REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT

AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY COMMENCEMENT CEREMONY



Howard University

Washington, D.C.







11:47 A.M. EDT



THE PRESIDENT: Thank you! Hello, Howard! (Applause.) H-U!=20



AUDIENCE: You know!



THE PRESIDENT: H-U!



AUDIENCE: You know!



THE PRESIDENT: (Laughter.) Thank you so much, everybody. Please, please, =
have a seat. Oh, I feel important now. Got a degree from Howard. Cicely T=
yson said something nice about me. (Laughter.)=20



AUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you, President!



THE PRESIDENT: I love you back.=20



To President Frederick, the Board of Trustees, faculty and staff, fellow =
recipients of honorary degrees, thank you for the honor of spending this =
day with you. And congratulations to the Class of 2016! (Applause.) Four =
years ago, back when you were just freshmen, I understand many of you cam=
e by my house the night I was reelected. (Laughter.) So I decided to retu=
rn the favor and come by yours.



To the parents, the grandparents, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, all t=
he family and friends who stood by this class, cheered them on, helped th=
em get here today -- this is your day, as well. Lets give them a big roun=
d of applause, as well. (Applause.)=20



Im not trying to stir up any rivalries here; I just want to see whos in t=
he house. We got Quad? (Applause.) Annex. (Applause.) Drew. Carver. Slow.=
 Towers. And Meridian. (Applause.) Rest in peace, Meridian. (Laughter.) R=
est in peace.=20



I know youre all excited today. You might be a little tired, as well. Som=
e of you were up all night making sure your credits were in order. (Laugh=
ter.) Some of you stayed up too late, ended up at HoChi at 2:00 a.m. (Lau=
ghter.) Got some mambo sauce on your fingers. (Laughter.)=20



But you got here. And you've all worked hard to reach this day. Youve shu=
ttled between challenging classes and Greek life. You've led clubs, playe=
d an instrument or a sport. You volunteered, you interned. You held down =
one, two, maybe three jobs. You've made lifelong friends and discovered e=
xactly what youre made of. The Howard Hustle has strengthened your sense =
of purpose and ambition.=20



Which means you're part of a long line of Howard graduates. Some are on t=
his stage today. Some are in the audience. That spirit of achievement and=
 special responsibility has defined this campus ever since the Freedmans =
Bureau established Howard just four years after the Emancipation Proclama=
tion; just two years after the Civil War came to an end. They created thi=
s university with a vision -- a vision of uplift; a vision for an America=
 where our fates would be determined not by our race, gender, religion or=
 creed, but where we would be free -- in every sense -- to pursue our ind=
ividual and collective dreams.



It is that spirit that's made Howard a centerpiece of African-American in=
tellectual life and a central part of our larger American story. This ins=
titution has been the home of many firsts: The first black Nobel Peace Pr=
ize winner. The first black Supreme Court justice. But its mission has be=
en to ensure those firsts were not the last. Countless scholars, professi=
onals, artists, and leaders from every field received their training here=
. The generations of men and women who walked through this yard helped re=
form our government, cure disease, grow a black middle class, advance civ=
il rights, shape our culture. The seeds of change -- for all Americans --=
 were sown here. And thats what I want to talk about today.



As I was preparing these remarks, I realized that when I was first electe=
d President, most of you -- the Class of 2016 -- were just starting high =
school. Today, youre graduating college. I used to joke about being old. =
Now I realize I'm old. (Laughter.) It's not a joke anymore. (Laughter.)=20=




But seeing all of you here gives me some perspective. It makes me reflect=
 on the changes that Ive seen over my own lifetime. So let me begin with =
what may sound like a controversial statement -- a hot take.



Given the current state of our political rhetoric and debate, let me say =
something that may be controversial, and that is this: America is a bette=
r place today than it was when I graduated from college. (Applause.) Let =
me repeat: America is by almost every measure better than it was when I g=
raduated from college. It also happens to be better off than when I took =
office -- (laughter) -- but that's a longer story. (Applause.) That's a d=
ifferent discussion for another speech.=20



But think about it. I graduated in 1983. New York City, Americas largest =
city, where I lived at the time, had endured a decade marked by crime and=
 deterioration and near bankruptcy. And many cities were in similar shape=
. Our nation had gone through years of economic stagnation, the strangleh=
old of foreign oil, a recession where unemployment nearly scraped 11 perc=
ent. The auto industry was getting its clock cleaned by foreign competiti=
on. And dont even get me started on the clothes and the hairstyles. I've =
tried to eliminate all photos of me from this period. I thought I looked =
good. (Laughter.) I was wrong.=20



Since that year -- since the year I graduated -- the poverty rate is down=
. Americans with college degrees, that rate is up. Crime rates are down. =
Americas cities have undergone a renaissance. There are more women in the=
 workforce. Theyre earning more money. Weve cut teen pregnancy in half. W=
e've slashed the African American dropout rate by almost 60 percent, and =
all of you have a computer in your pocket that gives you the world at the=
 touch of a button. In 1983, I was part of fewer than 10 percent of Afric=
an Americans who graduated with a bachelors degree. Today, youre part of =
the more than 20 percent who will. And more than half of blacks say were =
better off than our parents were at our age -- and that our kids will be =
better off, too.



So America is better. And the world is better, too. A wall came down in B=
erlin. An Iron Curtain was torn asunder. The obscenity of apartheid came =
to an end. A young generation in Belfast and London have grown up without=
 ever having to think about IRA bombings. In just the past 16 years, weve=
 come from a world without marriage equality to one where its a reality i=
n nearly two dozen countries. Around the world, more people live in democ=
racies. Weve lifted more than 1 billion people from extreme poverty. Weve=
 cut the child mortality rate worldwide by more than half.=20



America is better. The world is better. And stay with me now -- race rela=
tions are better since I graduated. Thats the truth. No, my election did =
not create a post-racial society. I dont know who was propagating that no=
tion. That was not mine. But the election itself -- and the subsequent on=
e -- because the first one, folks might have made a mistake. (Laughter.) =
The second one, they knew what they were getting. The election itself was=
 just one indicator of how attitudes had changed.=20



In my inaugural address, I remarked that just 60 years earlier, my father=
 might not have been served in a D.C. restaurant -- at least not certain =
of them. There were no black CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. Very few blac=
k judges. Shoot, as Larry Wilmore pointed out last week, a lot of folks d=
idnt even think blacks had the tools to be a quarterback. Today, former B=
ull Michael Jordan isnt just the greatest basketball player of all time -=
- he owns the team. (Laughter.) When I was graduating, the main black her=
o on TV was Mr. T. (Laughter.) Rap and hip hop were counterculture, under=
ground. Now, Shonda Rhimes owns Thursday night, and Beyonc runs the world=
. (Laughter.) Were no longer only entertainers, we're producers, studio e=
xecutives. No longer small business owners -- we're CEOs, were mayors, re=
presentatives, Presidents of the United States. (Applause.)=20



I am not saying gaps do not persist. Obviously, they do. Racism persists.=
 Inequality persists. Dont worry -- Im going to get to that. But I wanted=
 to start, Class of 2016, by opening your eyes to the moment that you are=
 in. If you had to choose one moment in history in which you could be bor=
n, and you didnt know ahead of time who you were going to be -- what nati=
onality, what gender, what race, whether youd be rich or poor, gay or str=
aight, what faith you'd be born into -- you wouldnt choose 100 years ago.=
 You wouldnt choose the fifties, or the sixties, or the seventies. Youd c=
hoose right now. If you had to choose a time to be, in the words of Lorra=
ine Hansberry, young, gifted, and black in America, you would choose righ=
t now. (Applause.)=20



I tell you all this because it's important to note progress. Because to d=
eny how far weve come would do a disservice to the cause of justice, to t=
he legions of foot soldiers; to not only the incredibly accomplished indi=
viduals who have already been mentioned, but your mothers and your dads, =
and grandparents and great grandparents, who marched and toiled and suffe=
red and overcame to make this day possible. I tell you this not to lull y=
ou into complacency, but to spur you into action -- because theres still =
so much more work to do, so many more miles to travel. And America needs =
you to gladly, happily take up that work. You all have some work to do. S=
o enjoy the party, because you're going to be busy. (Laughter.)=20



Yes, our economy has recovered from crisis stronger than almost any other=
 in the world. But there are folks of all races who are still hurting -- =
who still cant find work that pays enough to keep the lights on, who stil=
l cant save for retirement. Weve still got a big racial gap in economic o=
pportunity. The overall unemployment rate is 5 percent, but the black une=
mployment rate is almost nine. Weve still got an achievement gap when bla=
ck boys and girls graduate high school and college at lower rates than wh=
ite boys and white girls. Harriet Tubman may be going on the twenty, but =
weve still got a gender gap when a black woman working full-time still ea=
rns just 66 percent of what a white man gets paid. (Applause.)=20



Weve got a justice gap when too many black boys and girls pass through a =
pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails. This is one area =
where things have gotten worse. When I was in college, about half a milli=
on people in America were behind bars. Today, there are about 2.2 million=
. Black men are about six times likelier to be in prison right now than w=
hite men.=20



Around the world, weve still got challenges to solve that threaten everyb=
ody in the 21st century -- old scourges like disease and conflict, but al=
so new challenges, from terrorism and climate change.=20



So make no mistake, Class of 2016 -- youve got plenty of work to do. But =
as complicated and sometimes intractable as these challenges may seem, th=
e truth is that your generation is better positioned than any before you =
to meet those challenges, to flip the script.=20



Now, how you do that, how you meet these challenges, how you bring about =
change will ultimately be up to you. My generation, like all generations,=
 is too confined by our own experience, too invested in our own biases, t=
oo stuck in our ways to provide much of the new thinking that will be req=
uired. But us old-heads have learned a few things that might be useful in=
 your journey. So with the rest of my time, Id like to offer some suggest=
ions for how young leaders like you can fulfill your destiny and shape ou=
r collective future -- bend it in the direction of justice and equality a=
nd freedom.



First of all -- and this should not be a problem for this group -- be con=
fident in your heritage. (Applause.) Be confident in your blackness. One =
of the great changes thats occurred in our country since I was your age i=
s the realization there's no one way to be black. Take it from somebody w=
hos seen both sides of debate about whether I'm black enough. (Laughter.)=
 In the past couple months, Ive had lunch with the Queen of England and h=
osted Kendrick Lamar in the Oval Office. Theres no straitjacket, there's =
no constraints, there's no litmus test for authenticity.=20



Look at Howard. One thing most folks dont know about Howard is how divers=
e it is. When you arrived here, some of you were like, oh, they've got bl=
ack people in Iowa? (Laughter.) But its true -- this class comes from big=
 cities and rural communities, and some of you crossed oceans to study he=
re. You shatter stereotypes. Some of you come from a long line of Bison. =
Some of you are the first in your family to graduate from college. (Appla=
use.) You all talk different, you all dress different. Youre Lakers fans,=
 Celtics fans, maybe even some hockey fans. (Laughter.)=20



And because of those who've come before you, you have models to follow. Y=
ou can work for a company, or start your own. You can go into politics, o=
r run an organization that holds politicians accountable. You can write a=
 book that wins the National Book Award, or you can write the new run of =
Black Panther. Or, like one of your alumni, Ta-Nehisi Coates, you can go =
ahead and just do both. You can create your own style, set your own stand=
ard of beauty, embrace your own sexuality. Think about an icon we just lo=
st -- Prince. He blew up categories. People didnt know what Prince was do=
ing. (Laughter.) And folks loved him for it.=20



You need to have the same confidence. Or as my daughters tell me all the =
time, You be you, Daddy. (Laughter.) Sometimes Sasha puts a variation on =
it -- "You do you, Daddy." (Laughter.) And because youre a black person d=
oing whatever it is that you're doing, that makes it a black thing. Feel =
confident.



Second, even as we each embrace our own beautiful, unique, and valid vers=
ions of our blackness, remember the tie that does bind us as African Amer=
icans -- and that is our particular awareness of injustice and unfairness=
 and struggle. That means we cannot sleepwalk through life. We cannot be =
ignorant of history. (Applause.) We cant meet the world with a sense of e=
ntitlement. We cant walk by a homeless man without asking why a society a=
s wealthy as ours allows that state of affairs to occur. We cant just loc=
k up a low-level dealer without asking why this boy, barely out of childh=
ood, felt he had no other options. We have cousins and uncles and brother=
s and sisters who we remember were just as smart and just as talented as =
we were, but somehow got ground down by structures that are unfair and un=
just.=20



And that means we have to not only question the world as it is, and stand=
 up for those African Americans who havent been so lucky -- because, yes,=
 you've worked hard, but you've also been lucky. That's a pet peeve of mi=
ne: People who have been successful and dont realize they've been lucky. =
That God may have blessed them; it wasnt nothing you did. So dont have an=
 attitude. But we must expand our moral imaginations to understand and em=
pathize with all people who are struggling, not just black folks who are =
struggling -- the refugee, the immigrant, the rural poor, the transgender=
 person, and yes, the middle-aged white guy who you may think has all the=
 advantages, but over the last several decades has seen his world upended=
 by economic and cultural and technological change, and feels powerless t=
o stop it. You got to get in his head, too.



Number three: You have to go through life with more than just passion for=
 change; you need a strategy. I'll repeat that. I want you to have passio=
n, but you have to have a strategy. Not just awareness, but action. Not j=
ust hashtags, but votes.=20



You see, change requires more than righteous anger. It requires a program=
, and it requires organizing. At the 1964 Democratic Convention, Fannie L=
ou Hamer -- all five-feet-four-inches tall -- gave a fiery speech on the =
national stage. But then she went back home to Mississippi and organized =
cotton pickers. And she didn't have the tools and technology where you ca=
n whip up a movement in minutes. She had to go door to door. And Im so pr=
oud of the new guard of black civil rights leaders who understand this. I=
ts thanks in large part to the activism of young people like many of you,=
 from Black Twitter to Black Lives Matter, that Americas eyes have been o=
pened -- white, black, Democrat, Republican -- to the real problems, for =
example, in our criminal justice system.

""

But to bring about structural change, lasting change, awareness is not en=
ough. It requires changes in law, changes in custom. If you care about ma=
ss incarceration, let me ask you: How are you pressuring members of Congr=
ess to pass the criminal justice reform bill now pending before them? (Ap=
plause.) If you care about better policing, do you know who your district=
 attorney is? Do you know who your states attorney general is? Do you kno=
w the difference? Do you know who appoints the police chief and who write=
s the police training manual? Find out who they are, what their responsib=
ilities are. Mobilize the community, present them with a plan, work with =
them to bring about change, hold them accountable if they do not deliver.=
 Passion is vital, but you've got to have a strategy.



And your plan better include voting -- not just some of the time, but all=
 the time. (Applause.) It is absolutely true that 50 years after the Voti=
ng Rights Act, there are still too many barriers in this country to vote.=
 There are too many people trying to erect new barriers to voting. This i=
s the only advanced democracy on Earth that goes out of its way to make i=
t difficult for people to vote. And there's a reason for that. There's a =
legacy to that.=20



But let me say this: Even if we dismantled every barrier to voting, that =
alone would not change the fact that America has some of the lowest votin=
g rates in the free world. In 2014, only 36 percent of Americans turned o=
ut to vote in the midterms -- the secondlowest participation rate on reco=
rd. Youth turnout -- that would be you -- was less than 20 percent. Less =
than 20 percent. Four out of five did not vote. In 2012, nearly two in th=
ree African Americans turned out. And then, in 2014, only two in five tur=
ned out. You dont think that made a difference in terms of the Congress I=
've got to deal with? And then people are wondering, well, how come Obama=
 hasnt gotten this done? How come he didnt get that done? You dont think =
that made a difference? What would have happened if you had turned out at=
 50, 60, 70 percent, all across this country? People try to make this pol=
itical thing really complicated. Like, what kind of reforms do we need? A=
nd how do we need to do that? You know what, just vote. It's math. If you=
 have more votes than the other guy, you get to do what you want. (Laught=
er.) It's not that complicated.=20



And you dont have excuses. You dont have to guess the number of jellybean=
s in a jar or bubbles on a bar of soap to register to vote. You dont have=
 to risk your life to cast a ballot. Other people already did that for yo=
u. (Applause.) Your grandparents, your great grandparents might be here t=
oday if they were working on it. What's your excuse? When we dont vote, w=
e give away our power, disenfranchise ourselves -- right when we need to =
use the power that we have; right when we need your power to stop others =
from taking away the vote and rights of those more vulnerable than you ar=
e -- the elderly and the poor, the formerly incarcerated trying to earn t=
heir second chance.

So you got to vote all the time, not just when its cool, not just when it=
's time to elect a President, not just when youre inspired. It's your dut=
y. When its time to elect a member of Congress or a city councilman, or a=
 school board member, or a sheriff. Thats how we change our politics -- b=
y electing people at every level who are representative of and accountabl=
e to us. It is not that complicated. Dont make it complicated.

""

And finally, change requires more than just speaking out -- it requires l=
istening, as well. In particular, it requires listening to those with who=
m you disagree, and being prepared to compromise. When I was a state sena=
tor, I helped pass Illinoiss first racial profiling law, and one of the f=
irst laws in the nation requiring the videotaping of confessions in capit=
al cases. And we were successful because, early on, I engaged law enforce=
ment. I didnt say to them, oh, you guys are so racist, you need to do som=
ething. I understood, as many of you do, that the overwhelming majority o=
f police officers are good, and honest, and courageous, and fair, and lov=
e the communities they serve.=20



And we knew there were some bad apples, and that even the good cops with =
the best of intentions -- including, by the way, African American police =
officers -- might have unconscious biases, as we all do. So we engaged an=
d we listened, and we kept working until we built consensus. And because =
we took the time to listen, we crafted legislation that was good for the =
police -- because it improved the trust and cooperation of the community =
-- and it was good for the communities, who were less likely to be treate=
d unfairly. And I can say this unequivocally: Without at least the accept=
ance of the police organizations in Illinois, I could never have gotten t=
hose bills passed. Very simple. They would have blocked them.=20



The point is, you need allies in a democracy. That's just the way it is. =
It can be frustrating and it can be slow. But history teaches us that the=
 alternative to democracy is always worse. That's not just true in this c=
ountry. Its not a black or white thing. Go to any country where the give =
and take of democracy has been repealed by one-party rule, and I will sho=
w you a country that does not work.=20



And democracy requires compromise, even when you are 100 percent right. T=
his is hard to explain sometimes. You can be completely right, and you st=
ill are going to have to engage folks who disagree with you. If you think=
 that the only way forward is to be as uncompromising as possible, you wi=
ll feel good about yourself, you will enjoy a certain moral purity, but y=
oure not going to get what you want. And if you dont get what you want lo=
ng enough, you will eventually think the whole system is rigged. And that=
 will lead to more cynicism, and less participation, and a downward spira=
l of more injustice and more anger and more despair. And that's never bee=
n the source of our progress. That's how we cheat ourselves of progress.



We remember Dr. Kings soaring oratory, the power of his letter from a Bir=
mingham jail, the marches he led. But he also sat down with President Joh=
nson in the Oval Office to try and get a Civil Rights Act and a Voting Ri=
ghts Act passed. And those two seminal bills were not perfect -- just lik=
e the Emancipation Proclamation was a war document as much as it was some=
 clarion call for freedom. Those mileposts of our progress were not perfe=
ct. They did not make up for centuries of slavery or Jim Crow or eliminat=
e racism or provide for 40 acres and a mule. But they made things better.=
 And you know what, I will take better every time. I always tell my staff=
 -- better is good, because you consolidate your gains and then you move =
on to the next fight from a stronger position.=20



Brittany Packnett, a member of the Black Lives Matter movement and Campai=
gn Zero, one of the Ferguson protest organizers, she joined our Task Forc=
e on 21st Century Policing. Some of her fellow activists questioned wheth=
er she should participate. She rolled up her sleeves and sat at the same =
table with big city police chiefs and prosecutors. And because she did, s=
he ended up shaping many of the recommendations of that task force. And t=
hose recommendations are now being adopted across the country -- changes =
that many of the protesters called for. If young activists like Brittany =
had refused to participate out of some sense of ideological purity, then =
those great ideas would have just remained ideas. But she did participate=
. And thats how change happens.



America is big and it is boisterous and it is more diverse than ever. The=
 president told me that we've got a significant Nepalese contingent here =
at Howard. I would not have guessed that. Right on. But it just tells you=
 how interconnected we're becoming. And with so many folks from so many p=
laces, converging, we are not always going to agree with each other.=20



Another Howard alum, Zora Neale Hurston, once said -- this is a good quot=
e here: Nothing that God ever made is the same thing to more than one per=
son. Think about that. Thats why our democracy gives us a process designe=
d for us to settle our disputes with argument and ideas and votes instead=
 of violence and simple majority rule.=20



So dont try to shut folks out, dont try to shut them down, no matter how =
much you might disagree with them. There's been a trend around the countr=
y of trying to get colleges to disinvite speakers with a different point =
of view, or disrupt a politicians rally. Dont do that -- no matter how ri=
diculous or offensive you might find the things that come out of their mo=
uths. Because as my grandmother used to tell me, every time a fool speaks=
, they are just advertising their own ignorance. Let them talk. Let them =
talk. If you dont, you just make them a victim, and then they can avoid a=
ccountability.=20



That doesnt mean you shouldnt challenge them. Have the confidence to chal=
lenge them, the confidence in the rightness of your position. There will =
be times when you shouldnt compromise your core values, your integrity, a=
nd you will have the responsibility to speak up in the face of injustice.=
 But listen. Engage. If the other side has a point, learn from them. If t=
heyre wrong, rebut them. Teach them. Beat them on the battlefield of idea=
s. And you might as well start practicing now, because one thing I can gu=
arantee you -- you will have to deal with ignorance, hatred, racism, fool=
ishness, trifling folks. (Laughter.) I promise you, you will have to deal=
 with all that at every stage of your life. That may not seem fair, but l=
ife has never been completely fair. Nobody promised you a crystal stair. =
And if you want to make life fair, then you've got to start with the worl=
d as it is.=20



So thats my advice. Thats how you change things. Change isnt something th=
at happens every four years or eight years; change is not placing your fa=
ith in any particular politician and then just putting your feet up and s=
aying, okay, go. Change is the effort of committed citizens who hitch the=
ir wagons to something bigger than themselves and fight for it every sing=
le day.=20



Thats what Thurgood Marshall understood -- a man who once walked this yea=
r, graduated from Howard Law; went home to Baltimore, started his own law=
 practice. He and his mentor, Charles Hamilton Houston, rolled up their s=
leeves and they set out to overturn segregation. They worked through the =
NAACP. Filed dozens of lawsuits, fought dozens of cases. And after nearly=
 20 years of effort -- 20 years -- Thurgood Marshall ultimately succeeded=
 in bringing his righteous cause before the Supreme Court, and securing t=
he ruling in Brown v. Board of Education that separate could never be equ=
al. (Applause.) Twenty years.=20



Marshall, Houston -- they knew it would not be easy. They knew it would n=
ot be quick. They knew all sorts of obstacles would stand in their way. T=
hey knew that even if they won, that would just be the beginning of a lon=
ger march to equality. But they had discipline. They had persistence. The=
y had faith -- and a sense of humor. And they made life better for all Am=
ericans.



And I know you graduates share those qualities. I know it because I've le=
arned about some of the young people graduating here today. There's a you=
ng woman named Ciearra Jefferson, whos graduating with you. And I'm just =
going to use her as an example. I hope you dont mind, Ciearra. Ciearra gr=
ew up in Detroit and was raised by a poor single mom who worked seven day=
s a week in an auto plant. And for a time, her family found themselves wi=
thout a place to call home. They bounced around between friends and famil=
y who might take them in. By her senior year, Ciearra was up at 5:00 am e=
very day, juggling homework, extracurricular activities, volunteering, al=
l while taking care of her little sister. But she knew that education was=
 her ticket to a better life. So she never gave up. Pushed herself to exc=
el. This daughter of a single mom who works on the assembly line turned d=
own a full scholarship to Harvard to come to Howard. (Applause.)=20



And today, like many of you, Ciearra is the first in her family to gradua=
te from college. And then, she says, shes going to go back to her hometow=
n, just like Thurgood Marshall did, to make sure all the working folks sh=
e grew up with have access to the health care they need and deserve. As s=
he puts it, shes going to be a change agent. Shes going to reach back and=
 help folks like her succeed.=20



And people like Ciearra are why I remain optimistic about America. (Appla=
use.) Young people like you are why I never give in to despair.=20



James Baldwin once wrote, Not everything that is faced can be changed, bu=
t nothing can be changed until it is faced.



Graduates, each of us is only here because someone else faced down challe=
nges for us. We are only who we are because someone else struggled and sa=
crificed for us. That's not just Thurgood Marshalls story, or Ciearras st=
ory, or my story, or your story -- that is the story of America. A story =
whispered by slaves in the cotton fields, the song of marchers in Selma, =
the dream of a King in the shadow of Lincoln. The prayer of immigrants wh=
o set out for a new world. The roar of women demanding the vote. The rall=
ying cry of workers who built America. And the GIs who bled overseas for =
our freedom.=20



Now its your turn. And the good news is, youre ready. And when your journ=
ey seems too hard, and when you run into a chorus of cynics who tell you =
that youre being foolish to keep believing or that you cant do something,=
 or that you should just give up, or you should just settle -- you might =
say to yourself a little phrase that Ive found handy these last eight yea=
rs: Yes, we can.



Congratulations, Class of 2016! (Applause.) Good luck! God bless you. God=
 bless the United States of America. I'm proud of you.=20
