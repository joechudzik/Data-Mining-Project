I think when Donald Trump debates Hillary Clinton she's going to go down li=
ke Monica Lewinsky," Broward County Republican Chairman Bob Sutton told the=
 Washington Post<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-womans-card=
-comment-escalates-gender-wars-of-2016-campaign/2016/04/27/fbe4c67a-0c2b-11=
e6-8ab8-9ad050f76d7d_story.html>.

It did not go over well.

"Mr. Sutton owes an apology to Hillary Clinton and the women of Broward Cou=
nty. He needs to resign. This is indicative of the open and blatant misogyn=
y of the Republican Party in the era of Trump. There is no excuse for his b=
ehavior, and the outright contempt his comments have shown for women."---- =
Broward County Democratic Party Chair Cynthia Busch

=93Without question, Mr. Sutton must apologize and resign immediately. Furt=
hermore, Florida GOP Chairman Blaise Ingoglia must end his stunning silence=
 and condemn this obscene rhetoric. To say that these vile, sexist comments=
 have no place in our politics would be a profound understatement.=94 --- F=
lorida Democratic Party Chair Allison Tant

=93While Republican Party leaders have long pushed policies that deny women=
 their rights, Donald Trump=92s ugly, misogynistic and divisive rhetoric is=
 now giving the GOP permission to be derogatory and hateful. The comments t=
oday from this local Republican county chairman reveal how deeply sexism an=
d chauvinism is embedded in the Republican Party. Comments like these are i=
nsulting to all women regardless of political party and have no place in ou=
r nation=92s discourse. I call on my counterpart at the RNC to join me in c=
ondemning the use of any language that seeks to belittle and degrade women.=
 Hopefully we can at least agree on that.=94  ---- Democratic National Comm=
ittee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz

Donald Trump already has signalled his readiness to go after Bill Clinton's=
 infedility, and this is likely a sign of how Democrats are preparing to re=
spond.
