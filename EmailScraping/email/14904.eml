As millions of Americans file their taxes, DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman =

w the Republican presidential candidates are promising tax breaks for the w=
ealthy at the expense of most American tax payers.


Meet the new GOP tax plan<http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/18/opinions/new-gop-ta=
x-plan-opinion-wasserman-schultz/>

CNN // DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ



(CNN) It's tax season, and the Republican candidates for president are once=
 again beating their favorite broken drum on the campaign trail and calling=
 for massive tax cuts for those at the top.



As millions of Americans go to file their taxes, this is a good time to rem=
ember what happened when the last Republican president slashed taxes for to=
p earners without a plan to pay for it, and to consider what it would mean =
to our economy if one of the current extreme GOP candidates gets the chance=
 to do the same, or worse.



George W. Bush's tax cuts, which were sold to the American people as a way =
to fuel private sector growth, instead increased income inequality<http://m=
oney.cnn.com/2012/01/03/news/economy/income_inequality/> and mostly benefit=
ed the wealthy.



As a result of Bush's economic policies, by the end of his second term, our=
 economy was losing 800,000 jobs a month, foreclosure signs littered the st=
reets in communities across the country, and too many people had to choose =
between illness and bankruptcy from medical bills. CEO pay ballooned, wages=
 stagnated for America's middle class, and fewer private-sector jobs were c=
reated than before the tax cuts went into effect.

<http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/18/opinions/insurgents-new-york-primary-opinion=
-louis/index.html>

The tax plans and policies proposed by today's GOP candidates would go even=
 further than the Bush tax cuts and would not only continue to widen the in=
come gap, but would also balloon the deficit.



According to the Tax Policy Center, Donald Trump's plan <http://www.taxpoli=
cycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan> would slash fede=
ral revenues by $9.5 trillion over 10 years and could increase the national=
 debt by a staggering 80% of GDP by the year 2036. Ted Cruz's plan<http://w=
ww.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-ted-cruzs-tax-plan>, which inc=
ludes a dangerous and ill-conceived promise to abolish the IRS, isn't any l=
ess extreme, and would slash revenues by $8.6 trillion over 10 years.

<http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/26/opinions/yelp-millennial-low-wages-soave/ind=
ex.html>

Under the plans of Trump, Cruz and GOP Gov. John Kasich, new tax cuts would=
 once again largely benefit the wealthy over the middle class. These plans =
would require harsh cuts to life-saving programs such as Medicare and Medic=
aid and would slash investments in public goods like education and infrastr=
ucture to pay for them.



That's the wrong direction for our country, especially considering the fact=
 that a new study<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/11/wh=
ere-living-poor-means-dying-young/> last week by the Journal of the America=
n Medical Association showed that progressive policies, "such as universal =
preschool, paid sick leave and paid parental leave ... ease the stresses as=
sociated with poverty that affect health." Life expectancies are higher -- =
in some cases a difference of three years -- in communities where these pol=
icies are enacted and a strong safety net exists.

<http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/13/opinions/cnn-trump-town-hall-reyes/index.htm=
l>

But Republicans remain committed to rewarding the wealthy rather than worki=
ng to improve the quality of life for hardworking families. All the candida=
tes have vowed to repeal Obamacare<http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-ele=
ction/gop-2016-candidates-not-giving-fight-against-obamacare-n381721>, a la=
w that has allowed 20 million Americans to gain quality, affordable health =
insurance that they previously didn't have.



None of the GOP presidential candidates favor ensuring equal pay for women,=
 despite women in the aggregate earning only .79 cents to every dollar<http=
://www.nationalpartnership.org/research-library/workplace-fairness/fair-pay=
/americas-women-and-the-wage-gap.pdf> earned by their male counterparts. No=
t<http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/28/news/economy/donald-trump-polls-taxes-wag=
es/?iid=3DEL> a <http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-01-26/the-=
republican-approach-to-the-minimum-wage> single Republican running for pres=
ident supports raising the minimum wage; Donald Trump even went as far as s=
aying that wages are "too high."<http://theweek.com/speedreads/588147/donal=
d-trump-kicks-gop-debate-by-saying-american-wages-are-high>



The American people deserve a leader who will stand strong against the wind=
s of political pressure and deliver real solutions for the difficult proble=
ms hardworking families face every day. Republicans are only offering empty=
 promises and more handouts to those at the top. That's why we need Democra=
tic leadership in the White House to build on the progress of the last seve=
n years.<http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/18/opinions/no-financial-stability-toda=
y-conway/index.html>



Under President Obama, we've seen a record 73 straight months of private-se=
ctor job growth with 14.4 million jobs created. And because Democrats stand=
 for smart fiscal management built on a foundation of fairness, we worked t=
o cut taxes for over 98% of families with the American Taxpayer Relief Act,=
 which asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a fairer share.



That's the kind of leadership the next Democratic president will bring to t=
he White House. We tried the Republican plan and it failed America's middle=
 class. We must elect a Democrat as our 45th president if we want to contin=
ue to build on our economic progress.
