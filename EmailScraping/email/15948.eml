Andrew --

My husband has always been a leader who puts people and family first.

After leading a successful business career, Phil joined Howard Dean to =
help rebuild the national Democratic Party from the grassroots up. And =
then he answered President Obama's call to serve our country as Ambassador =
to Germany.=20

Here in New Jersey, we've worked together to create organizations that =
help domestic abuse survivors and troubled teens, impacting thousands of =
lives for the better.

Throughout our marriage, Phil has made serving others a way of life for =
our family -- but don't just take my word for it, watch this video and =
share it with your friends:

https://go.Murphy4NJ.com/Watch-Meet-Phil-Murphy

Phil's parents may not have had much -- they often lived paycheck to =
paycheck -- but they raised him to have a great moral compass, taught him =
to care for those around him, and pushed him to have a strong work ethic. =
They also believed deeply in the power of public education to give him a =
better future than their own.

He's never forgotten his roots or the people and institutions that have =
helped him live the American Dream. As a husband, father, and proud New =
Jerseyan, Phil knows we're all in this together.=20

I think his unique blend of energy, compassion, honesty, and experience is =
what makes Phil the different kind of leader we need to move the Garden =
State forward to a better tomorrow.=20

Andrew, watch this new video and share Phil's story with your friends and =
family:=20
