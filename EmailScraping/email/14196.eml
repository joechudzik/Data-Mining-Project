Donald Trump Amplifies His Stances on Tax Cuts, U.S.=92s Debt<http://www.ws=
j.com/articles/trump-reiterates-call-for-big-tax-cuts-1462826682>

Donald Trump sought Monday to clarify his views on fiscal and monetary poli=
cy, saying he was open to compromise on tax cuts but wouldn=92t try to alte=
r the terms of the nation=92s $19 trillion in debt, which he called =93abso=
lutely sacred.=94

In an interview Monday, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee mov=
ed to tamp down jitters over remarks in recent days suggesting he might pus=
h to renegotiate U.S. debt in an economic downturn.

=93This is the United States government,=94 he said Monday. =93The bonds ar=
e absolutely sacred.=94

the party, Mr. Trump is also trying to lock down support among Republicans =
fearful he may stray from conservative policy stances. Mr. Trump is schedul=
ed to meet this week with House Speaker Paul Ryan, an ardent tax cutter who=
 has said he wants to better understand the New York businessman=92s positi=
ons before backing his candidacy. After Mr. Ryan=92s comments provoked a se=
ries of sharp exchanges between the two camps, the speaker said Monday that=
 he would step aside as chairman<http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/05/09/p=
aul-ryan-says-he-would-quit-as-convention-chair-if-trump-asked/> of the GOP=
 nominating convention if Mr. Trump wanted him to.

On the debt issue, Mr. Trump suggested he would be open<http://www.wsj.com/=
articles/donald-trump-says-he-wouldnt-seek-to-renegotiate-u-s-debt-14628289=
48> to buying back Treasury notes if interest rates rise as a way to bring =
down the U.S. debt load. Bond prices fall as rates rise, which means the go=
vernment theoretically could turn a profit by buying back debt for less tha=
n when it was issued.

=93With the United States government there are times on occasion you can bu=
y back debt at a discount, meaning the interest rate goes up and you buy ba=
ck debt at a discount,=94 he said.

With the government now running large annual deficits, such a buyback would=
 require issuing new debt to purchase the old debt. Because that new debt w=
ould be issued at higher interest rates, it isn=92t clear that type of buyb=
ack would save money in the long run.

Mr. Trump also said he supported holding down the value of the dollar in or=
der to help American manufacturing and the economy. =93If the value of the =
dollar goes up, it would be at this point not a very good thing,=94 he said=
. Most American presidents typically advocate for a strong dollar.

On tax policy, Mr. Trump said that as president he would seek to persuade c=
ongressional Democrats to lower taxes on high-income households by trading =
on completely unrelated and unspecified policy issues.

=93There will be a give and take. They=92re going to want other things havi=
ng nothing to do with this,=94 Mr. Trump said. =93It=92s one very big, very=
 complex proposal, into a negotiation.=94

He said he was also open to changing his tax plan unveiled last year, which=
 proposed lowering tax rates, pushing 33 million households off the income-=
tax rolls and, according to an analysis, reducing federal revenue by nearly=
 $10 trillion over the next decade.

It=92s =93always possible to change,=94 Mr. Trump said. =93I always believe=
 in flexibility and remaining flexible.=94

Mr. Trump spoke after weekend TV appearances in which he said taxes on high=
-income households would go up<http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-say=
s-wealthy-may-see-tax-increase-1462741116>, then later said they would rise=
 only in comparison with his own tax-cutting proposal. His comments left so=
me Republican tax experts trying to decipher what the party=92s 2016 standa=
rd-bearer believes on a central GOP issue.

=93He really does seem to be saying different things on different days to d=
ifferent people,=94 said James Pethokoukis, a columnist and blogger at the =
conservative American Enterprise Institute. =93You can try to score, but yo=
u=92re only scoring one version of his reality. And the reality changes on =
a daily, if not hourly, basis.=94

Mr. Trump=92s approach to policy veers sharply from the tightly controlled,=
 thoroughly vetted style common in modern presidential campaigns. He hasn=
=92t built the network of outside analysts and surrogates who would normall=
y amplify a campaign=92s carefully written policy message.

At the same time, Mr. Trump seemed to be nodding toward his experience as a=
 dealmaker, saying that campaign policy proposals are just the starting poi=
nt in a negotiation.

=93He hasn=92t made an effort to put people around him who can give him rea=
lly solid advice about what to do, so this is what you end up with. You end=
 up with this meandering thing,=94 said Lanhee Chen, a top policy adviser t=
o Mitt Romney in 2012. =93He is able to kind of brush it off in a way that =
makes it seem like he=92s a savvy negotiator.=94

=93My core beliefs are I want a major tax cut,=94 Mr. Trump said in the int=
erview. =93And I=92m only being honest with people. You can=92t just say th=
is is what my plan will be. You have to negotiate this with many other peop=
le, and those many other people are congressmen and senators, etc., and eve=
rybody knows that you have to do that.=94

Aides to the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, said Monday that v=
oters should look past Mr. Trump=92s imprecise language and instead focus o=
n his actual plan, which he said Sunday was his =93optimum=94 policy. The t=
ax plan is the Republican=92s most specific economic policy, said Clinton p=
olicy adviser Jake Sullivan, and Democrats will hold him to it.

=93The only thing one can do is look at the black and white of his paper an=
d not be fooled by his shifting comments,=94 said Gene Sperling, a Clinton =
adviser and former White House economic policy aide.

Mr. Trump=92s proposal calls for cutting the top tax rate on wages to 25% f=
rom 39.6% and for lowering the top rate on business income to 15%. Corporat=
ions now have a top rate of 35%, and many businesses report their profits o=
n their owners=92 individual returns, taxed at 39.6%. Mr. Trump said there =
would be unspecified =93rules and regulations=94 handled in =93a very order=
ly manner=94 to prevent people from converting wage income into lower-taxed=
 business income.

The Clinton campaign cited an analysis from the Tax Policy Center<http://ww=
w.wsj.com/articles/analysis-of-trumps-tax-plan-shows-big-cuts-in-taxes-fede=
ral-revenue-1450807194> showing that the top 0.1% of households would get a=
s much in tax cuts from Mr. Trump as the bottom 60% would.

Mr. Sperling, who called the Trump proposal =93risky=94 and =93reckless,=94=
 cited estimates from the Tax Foundation, a conservative-leaning group that=
 often produces results that show tax cuts boosting growth. Their analysis=
=97after including economic growth=97shows that Mr. Trump=92s plan would re=
duce federal revenue by more than $10 trillion over a decade, expand budget=
 deficits and give the income boosts to high-income households.

Mr. Trump dismissed those studies, in part because they didn=92t look at so=
mething that isn=92t knowable=97the end result of tax negotiations that wou=
ld occur after he becomes president.

=93They don=92t know what the final number is going to be after the negotia=
tion, OK?=94 he said. =93I=92d love to say it=92s going to stay where it is=
, but it won=92t. It=92s going to be something that=92s negotiated. But als=
o, we=92re going to bring tremendous business to the country.=94

Mr. Trump=92s plan calls for =93reducing or eliminating most deductions and=
 loopholes available to the very rich.=94 Asked to be specific, Mr. Trump c=
ited carried interest, the tax provision that lets some investment professi=
onals pay lower capital-gains rates for managing other people=92s money.

But under his plan, the 15% tax rate on business income would be lower than=
 the 20% tax rate on capital gains. Investment managers would no longer nee=
d carried interest because they would rather be compensated in lower-taxed =
fees.

Asked to explain the contradiction, Mr. Trump said, =93You=92re right, depe=
nding on what the final deal is. But what I=92m going to do and what my pri=
ority is going to be is business and middle income.=94

Mr. Chen, the former Romney adviser who doesn=92t support Mr. Trump, said h=
e thought the Clinton campaign was running too traditional a response to th=
e Republican=92s policy agenda.

=93The guy can go from X to Y, from A to Z so quickly,=94 Mr. Chen said. =
=93They=92re the aircraft carrier and he=92s kind of the pirate ship.=94
