HOOSIER PICK: Indiana votes Tuesday and it has turned into, perhaps, TED CRUZ's final chance to stop DONALD TRUMP. For Trump, it's probably his best chance to deliver a crushing blow to Cruz's campaign before the convention in Cleveland.

Polls have shown Cruz trailing Trump. That may explain his posture on the final day of campaigning in the state. A final day of attacks, which included an ad that accuses Trump of lying http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fae114ac7e6dd774b06055a27ae232e4160753e78ef5fe8d860aee6d194be2fd amounted to a fierce closing argument for him in the state. 

Indiana's primary rules favor the statewide victor for the GOP - the popular vote winner grabs 30 of the state's 57 delegates. The other 27 are allotted three at a time to the winner of each of Indiana's nine congressional districts.

Trump, for his part, seemed to ignore Cruz - he attacked HILLARY CLINTON. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fae114ac7e6dd7745a85e98bff64a475020826660012dba5cb3621c55a5913ce 

For Democrats, HILLARY CLINTON's path to the Democratic nomination seems more assured. But victory in Indiana, which has 92 delegates at stake, could ease her path. Polls have shown her and BERNIE SANDERS running close in Indiana. 

Sanders has insisted that, whatever happens, he expects a contested convention. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fae114ac7e6dd7749fe4891a986dea1e0f920e567d18605ce10bd54479ad76ef And he spent his final day in Indiana seemingly at ease, hitting familiar points about income inequality - and having a laugh with a, uh, insistent supporter. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fae114ac7e6dd774e8658eef70a8a37ded17f7ea34b96b13384fbc9385595c2e

WHAT MATTERS: Here are four more things to do we're watching today - and why they matter. 

2) A TED TALK: As if difficult delegate math and DONALD TRUMP himself weren't enough, TED CRUZ found himself face-to-face with an irascible Trump supporter today. On national TV, no less. Cruz had an extended back-and-forth with a man wearing sunglasses who taunted him about delegate math and told him, "We don't want you," POLITICO's Nick Gass reports. Cruz responded that he was "entitled to his opinion, and I respect it." Then he blamed the media for covering it: "We just had an event that had three, four hundred supporters of our campaign, and six Donald Trump supporters came out, and to the shock of everybody, the media focused on the six Donald Trump supporters instead of the 300 Cruz
 supporters." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fae114ac7e6dd7747a28f7fc1d57638eb661c29b9268d85c519b340f8bc7e355 

3) $IGN OF THE TIME$: HILLARY CLINTON outraised BERNIE SANDERS in April, the first time this calendar year Clinton has done so. Her $36 million tally is about $10 million more than Sanders pulled in during the same month, POLITICO's Nick Gass reports. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fae114ac7e6dd7747331baca6e3e26da03d879b9eb939d07a7f364c4d82c7939 It's also a sign, beyond a delegate lead, of Clinton securing momentum in the Democratic nomination fight. Sanders is hardly giving up - in fact he's predicting a contested convention. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fae114ac7e6dd7749fe4891a986dea1e0f920e567d18605ce10bd54479ad76ef But Sanders' fundraising juggernaut had been an area he'd consistently bested Clinton. Clinton's fundraising is not without it's own asterisk, though: POLITICO's
 Kenneth P. Vogel and Isaac Arnsdorf report state parties have not been as much campaign cash from a joint fundraising arrangement as they had hoped. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fae114ac7e6dd77498e8a42219be1f976641c464dcd077db2bfe1e56cc0b0975 

4) DONALD DUCKED: A controversial vote that would have limited the influence of New Hampshire delegates loyal to DONALD TRUMP was postponed, POLITICO's Shane Goldmacher reports, a concession that came amid fierce resistance from Trump supporters in the state. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fae114ac7e6dd7744d4f76faf27aa2b701e0a725c796dc5ee38b6cdf55487838 The vote would have limited the influence of delegates loyal to Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. While Trump still could clinch the number of delegates he needs before Cleveland the move would have great implications if arrives with less than enough to win on the first ballot. As Goldmacher reported earlier, state officials had been pushing a plan that would have
 prevented any of Trump's delegates from serving on key committees at the RNC. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fae114ac7e6dd774d5764a8a5ad4d2003d4485086f2534ea15f7684bc2d6173f 

5) LEAVING NO MARC(O): Wonder why MARCO RUBIO hasn't endorsed TED CRUZ? Think beyond this election cycle, as POLITICO's Marc Caputo reports. It's not as though Rubio has gone soft on DONALD TRUMP, rather it's a bit of political calculus - Rubio does not see how his formal endorsement would help Cruz. It also avoids a situation where, if Rubio and Cruz run again in four years, Cruz can use Rubio's endorsement against him. Instead, Rubio is helping him with logistical stuff: Renting his fundraising list to the Texas senator, pulling his name from primary ballots where it is helpful and so forth. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fae114ac7e6dd77439aafad0180e901a17bc37c7df5ec6e56abf563066dae1ab 

TRAIL MIX: Elsewhere on the campaign trail, DONALD TRUMP blames the media. Heidi Cruz addresses those killer rumors. HILLARY CLINTON brings on a new old aide. She took a skeptical path to the Iran deal. BERNIE SANDERS has a great tech team and gets superimposed into "Seinfeld," which is awesome. 

BEAT THE PRESS: DONALD TRUMP, availing himself of a telephone interview with CNN, blamed the press for his absence from the White House Correspondents' Dinner. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fae114ac7e6dd774367e81313162b0cdbe72d581c17c76b379d9a4f45a6e5825 

ZODI-ASKED: Heidi Cruz addresses questions her husband, TED CRUZ, is the Zodiac killer. Yup. (Esquire). http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fae114ac7e6dd77471630853abec73188dafe284109bec31199dc261aa467179 

MOORE HELP: Longtime HILLARY CLINTON confidant and one-time Bill Clinton aide Minyon Moore is taking up a formal role with Hillary's 2016 effort. (The New York Times.) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fae114ac7e6dd7744a484a63a07f5df9b1a703a1478dbcfb91e3a2cbba0fc339 

IRAN ONE WAY, YOU RAN ANOTHER: HILLARY CLINTON and JOHN KERRY had different paths to supporting a nuclear deal with Iran. Clinton was much more skeptical. (The New York Times). http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fae114ac7e6dd774129e568ecd1f1e709a86fb03743f8536192dd1b88b4bf720 

TECH SUPPORT: Re/Code profiles the team who built BERNIE SANDERS' "killer" organizing app. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fae114ac7e6dd7742963d8fabe636c1c09ffecc1d6571cbf8bcc9d103c1ec695 

NO CONTEST CONTEST: BERNIE SANDERS can maybe force a contested convention but he would have a hard time winning that contest. (Washington Post) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fae114ac7e6dd7749db8bef55937933838270184bbdcd0dd8fc914e573df778a 

I'M SPEECHLESS. I HAVE NO SPEECH: Someone edited BERNIE SANDERS into "Seinfeld" as George and it works perfectly. Obviously. (Slate). http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fae114ac7e6dd774bac45c87e5dbd4f812ea672917946221f3526226d30b8a2b 

WHAT'S NEXT: 

Indiana votes Tuesday. But attention, especially in the Democratic race, shifts West - and to West Virginia. HILLARY CLINTON and BERNIE SANDERS travel to California and West Virginia this week. DONALD TRUMP is expected to talk on Indiana election night from ... Trump Tower in New York City.

THEY SAID IT: "You know, in my household, when a child behaves that way, they get a spanking." - TED CRUZ, addressing a "young man" in the audience who shouted, "You suck!" at his rally. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fae114ac7e6dd7741e7e82a6a43be4e183ce87f3ffb7a9247f51a834b4f2339c 

MAGIC NUMBER: 49. That's the percentage of Ohioans who want JOHN KASICH to drop out of the presidential race. 38 percent say he should stay in. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fae114ac7e6dd7744b74313440e874a0c72bfbf9058bc1d7b904a166a07b2344
