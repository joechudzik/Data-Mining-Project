President Obama is urging Congress to pass TPP<http://thehill.com/policy/fi=

THE HILL // VICKI NEEDHAM

President Obama on Monday said Congress needs to pass a sweeping Asia-Pacif=
ic trade agreement to ensure the United States takes the reins of global tr=
ade in the region instead of China. The Obama administration is working clo=
sely with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to build support for the 12-nation Tran=
s-Pacific Partnership (TPP), arguing that delaying votes on the deal will m=
ake it harder to pass the agreement, the president said in a Washington Pos=
t op-ed. "The world has changed," Obama said. "The rules are changing with =
it," he said. "The United States, not countries like China, should write th=
em. Let's seize this opportunity, pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership and ma=
ke sure America isn't holding the bag, but holding the pen." He argued that=
 the deal will grow the U.S. economy and strengthen national security. "But=
 none of this will happen if the TPP doesn't become a reality," Obama said.=
 "That's because the Asia-Pacific region will continue its economic integra=
tion, with or without the United States," he said.

Biden's Iraq hopes crash with reality<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05=

POLITICO // NAHAL TOOSI

Vice President Joe Biden landed in Baghdad last week with his aides optimis=
tically declaring that Iraq's political tumult had "trended in a more stabi=
lizing direction." But the vice president's plane had barely left Iraqi air=
space when the country's political divisions exploded, with hundreds of pro=
testers storming into Baghdad's Green Zone, occupying the fortified area fo=
r much of the weekend to demand an end to government corruption. The develo=
pments threaten to distract from the fight against the Islamic State, which=
 has grabbed vast swaths of Iraqi territory. At the same time, the situatio=
n underscores the limited influence U.S. officials - even one as deeply ver=
sed in Iraq as Biden - have over the politics of the country America invade=

opponents should rest on the shoulders of Iraqis because any overt U.S. rol=

Syria conflict 'out of control' warns Kerry amid push to save truce<http://=

US Secretary of State John Kerry has said the Syrian conflict is "in many w=

NEW YORK TIMES // MARK LANDLER

Early in 2011, after a hectic visit to Yemen, Secretary of State Hillary Cl=

to Sultan Qaboos bin Said about an idea one of his envoys first pitched to =
the State Department in the spring of 2009: that Oman serve as a conduit fo=

" It would be 18 months before she took up the sultan on his offer and disp=

Since just prior to World War II, the primary collectives for the major mus=

(ASCAP) and Broadcast Music Inc. (BMI) have operated under antitrust consen=
t decrees with the Department of Justice (DoJ). These consent decrees allow=

Default at hand, Congress faces new pressure to act on Puerto Rico<https://=

Hours before Puerto Rico missed hundreds of millions of dollars of bond pay=
ments, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Monday issued a new and urgent c=
all for Congress to pass legislation allowing the territory to restructure =
the $72 billion it owes to creditors. In a letter to House Speaker Paul D. =
Ryan (R-Wis.), Lew connected the island's fiscal crisis to the mosquito-bor=
ne Zika virus, which has spread through the Caribbean and was recently conf=
irmed to have claimed its first life on U.S. soil - a 70-year-old Puerto Ri=
can man who died in February from a bleeding disorder linked to Zika. "This=
 is not just a matter of financial liabilities and litigation," Lew wrote. =
"Hospitals continue to lay off workers, ration medication, reduce services,=
 and close floors. Moreover, despite the intensifying threat from the Zika =
virus, financial constraints have made it extremely difficult to counteract=
. Unsealed septic tanks, abandoned homes, cemeteries, and piles of old tire=
s, where mosquito larvae grow, for example, must all be treated, but the go=
vernment is struggling to pay for the work to be done."

When Puerto Rico took its first major step toward a catastrophic default on=

n debt payment due in early July. But while GOP congressional staff is work=
ing through the break to sketch out a Plan B - with an eye towards unveilin=

Hillary Clinton's allies are fuming over Bernie Sanders's vow to take the p=

n this summer. Many Democrats believe Clinton effectively clinched the nomi=
nation after a string of victories across the Northeast and mid-Atlantic ga=

Hillary Clinton brought in more campaign cash in April than rival Sen. Bern=
ie Sanders, the first time in months that the Democratic front-runner has b=
ested Sanders and his juggernaut of fervent supporters willing to donate ov=
er and over. Clinton's campaign said Monday it raised about $26.4 million i=
n donations for the primary. Sanders's campaign said Sunday that it brought=
 in $25.8 million in April. Clinton's success in April was due more to a dr=
amatic drop-off in Sanders's donations rather than a big spike in hers. San=
ders had brought in about $44 million a month in February and March; Clinto=
n's haul for March was about $27 million. The drop-off for Sanders coincide=

 57 delegates at stake, stands in the minds of many Republicans as the last=

WASHINGTON POST // PHILIP BUMP

There are two things that Donald Trump's opponents need to do to keep him f=
rom getting the Republican presidential nomination. The first is that they =
need to block him from getting 1,237 pledged delegates by the time voting w=
raps up in early June. The second is that they need to get people used to t=
he idea that a guy could walk into the convention with the most delegates a=
nd the most votes and walk out a very angry non-politician real estate magn=
ate. Both of those efforts are going badly. A new poll from CNN makes clear=
 the challenge Trump opponents face on that second point. Ninety-one percen=
t of Republicans think that Trump will be the nominee, and more people say =
they would be dissatisfied or upset with Ted Cruz or John Kasich winning th=
e nomination than say the same about Trump. What's more, Trump is the prefe=
rred second choice of 43 percent of those currently backing Cruz or Kasich.=
 So people think he'll win, more people will be more frustrated if he doesn=
't than if he does, and he has got a broader base of support.



Ted Cruz Stays Positive Despite Grim Numbers in Indiana<http://www.nytimes.=

NEW YORK TIMES // THOMAS KAPLAN

It almost resembled Iowa, if you squinted. Senator Ted Cruz expressed grati=
tude for the "common-sense good judgment" of Midwesterners. His stump speec=
h had scarcely changed, from a favorite anecdote about a drawling West Texa=
s farmer to a running countdown of the time remaining before the primary. (=
"Fifty-one hours," he said sternly.) He drew a crowd of several hundred at =
a faith-based community center here, whose cheers at times coaxed the Texas=
 senator to guttural shouts. One woman held a sign: "Pray'n For Ted." "The =
eyes of the entire country," Mr. Cruz said, "now rest on Indiana." Yet two =
days before what is widely viewed as a must-win primary, Mr. Cruz strained =
to conceal a grim reality: He is in serious trouble. An NBC News/Wall Stree=
t Journal/Marist poll released on Sunday showed Donald J. Trump with a lead=
 of 15 points among likely Republican primary voters, 49 percent to 34 perc=
ent.

THE HILL // BEN KASIMAR

Ted Cruz on Monday faced off against Donald Trump supporters who crashed an=
 event in Indiana, where the GOP hopeful is desperately working to upset th=
e front-runner and keep his White House dreams alive. Protestors started ch=
anting "Do the math" during Cruz's stop in Marion, Ind., prompting the Texa=

e man, who refused to give his name to reporters but said he had come from =
Ohio, interrupted Cruz and repeatedly called him "Lyin' Ted," Trump's favor=

LOS ANGELES TIMES // CHRISTINA BELLATONI

It was supposed to be a snoozer of a state party convention. Then the presi=
dential race came to California. And the events in Burlingame Friday throug=
h Sunday gave a little taste of what the next five weeks could be like on t=
he Republican side. It started Friday when Donald Trump attracted angry pro=
testers who forced him to traipse through a field to get into the conventio=
n site, then dismissed them during his brief speech to California Republica=
n activists. He declared the race was close to over. "I think it's going to=
 come to an end very soon," Trump said. "And really, I'm speaking to the pe=
ople in this room, because there has to be unity in our party." Sen. Ted Cr=
uz went after Trump for donating to Democrats, and his new running mate Car=
ly Fiorina offered a feisty stump speech to delegates Saturday night, takin=
g sharp jabs at Trump and those who oppose Cruz.

NEW YORK TIMES // ADAM NAGOURNEY

This is the most populous state in the nation, but in presidential election=
s, it has almost always found itself on the sidelines. The last time a Repu=
blican primary in California mattered was 52 years ago, when the party nomi=
nated Barry Goldwater. But California will finally play an important role i=
n the drama of presidential politics. The 172 Republican delegates up for g=
rabs in the state's June 7 primary, which in most years has taken place wel=
l after the party's presidential standard-bearer was known, will determine =
whether Donald J. Trump can clinch the nomination on the last day of voting=
 and avoid having to wrangle uncommitted delegates at the national conventi=
on in July. All three Republican presidential candidates, along with hundre=
ds of reporters, turned up for the party's state convention here over the w=
eekend, the biggest show in memory of presidential candidate firepower at t=

WASHINGTON POST // PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA

Over the past six years, America's businesses have created more than 14 mil=
lion new jobs. To keep this progress going, we need to pursue every avenue =
of economic growth. Today, some of our greatest economic opportunities abro=
ad are in the Asia-Pacific region, which is on its way to becoming the most=
 populous and lucrative market on the planet. Increasing trade in this area=
 of the world would be a boon to American businesses and American workers, =
and it would give us a leg up on our economic competitors, including one we=
 hear a lot about on the campaign trail these days: China. Of course, China=
's greatest economic opportunities also lie in its own neighborhood, which =
is why China is not wasting any time. As we speak, China is negotiating a t=
rade deal that would carve up some of the fastest-growing markets in the wo=
rld at our expense, putting American jobs, businesses and goods at risk.



Joe Biden Didn't Lose Iraq<http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/02/joe-biden-di=
dnt-lose-iraq-obama-did/>

FOREIGN POLICY // JAMES JEFFERY

The sudden trip of Vice President Joe Biden to Iraq this weekend - his firs=
t to Baghdad since U.S. troops left in late 2011 - was rudely upstaged by t=
he storming of the Green Zone by angry protesters on Sunday, just after the=
 veep had decamped to Erbil. But while the optics looked ugly, the trip - a=
nd focus on righting the ship in Iraq - has long been central to Biden. Sin=
ce the first days of the Obama White House, Biden has been the president's =
point man for what may be the administration's toughest portfolio. Presiden=
t Barack Obama ran on a "get out of Iraq" ticket in 2007, although he tried=
 after a fashion three years later to keep some forces on, and now has orde=
red 5,000 back to support operations against the Islamic State. In all of t=
his, Biden's role has been central. This should not surprise, given his ene=
rgy, his family relationship to Iraq (where his son served), his vote for t=
he invasion in 2002, and his close focus on events there as Senate Foreign =
Relations chair. But this long history is not without controversy. For exam=
ple, in 2006, he authored with Les Gelb, president emeritus of the Council =
on Foreign Relations, a plan, dead-on-arrival in Baghdad, for a soft petiti=
on of the country into Sunni Arab, Kurdish, and Shiite Arab cantons. That y=
ear, he also leaned toward a rapid withdrawal of U.S. forces - before the s=
urge reduced violence and, of course, before he was tapped as Obama's No. 2=
.

CHICAGO TRIBUNE // EDITORIAL BOARD

In the second round of the NCAA men's basketball tournament a few weeks ago=

Plenty of observers, of course, are eager to pronounce him the GOP winner s=

 an idea one of his envoys first pitched to the State Department in the spr=

 in presidential elections, it has almost always found itself on the sideli=
nes. The last time a Republican primary in California mattered
 was 52 years ago, when the party nominated Barry Goldwater. But California=
 will finally play an important role in the drama of presidential politics.=
 The 172 Republican delegates up for grabs in the state&#8217;s June 7 prim=
ary, which in most years has taken place
 well after the party&#8217;s presidential standard-bearer was known, will =
determine whether Donald J. Trump can clinch the nomination on the last day=
 of voting and avoid having to wrangle uncommitted delegates at the nationa=
l convention in July. All three Republican
 presidential candidates, along with hundreds of reporters, turned up for t=
he party&#8217;s state convention here over the weekend, the biggest show i=

we need to pursue every avenue of economic growth. Today, some

on the planet. Increasing trade in this area of the world would be a boon t=

q this weekend &#8212; his first to Baghdad since U.S. troops left in late =
2011 &#8212; was rudely upstaged by the storming of the Green Zone by
 angry protesters on Sunday, just after the veep had decamped to Erbil. But=
 while the optics looked ugly, the trip &#8212; and focus on righting the s=
hip in Iraq &#8212; has long been central to Biden. Since the first days of=
 the Obama White House, Biden has been the president&#8217;s
 point man for what may be the administration&#8217;s toughest portfolio. P=
resident Barack Obama ran on a &#8221;get out of Iraq&#8221; ticket in 2007=
, although he tried after a fashion three years later to keep some forces o=
n, and now has ordered 5,000 back to support operations
 against the Islamic State. In all of this, Biden&#8217;s role has been cen=
tral. This should not surprise, given his energy, his family relationship t=
o Iraq (where his son served), his vote for the invasion in 2002, and his c=
lose focus on events there as Senate Foreign
 Relations chair. But this long history is not without controversy. For exa=
mple, in 2006, he authored with Les Gelb, president emeritus of the Council=
 on Foreign Relations, a plan, dead-on-arrival in Baghdad, for a soft petit=
ion of the country into Sunni Arab,
 Kurdish, and Shiite Arab cantons. That year, he also leaned toward a rapid=
 withdrawal of U.S. forces &#8212; before the surge reduced violence and, o=
f course, before he was tapped as Obama&#8217;s No. 2.<o:p></o:p></span></p=

ournament a few weeks ago, Texas A&amp;M was in a hopeless spot, trailing N=
orthern Iowa by 12 points with just 44 seconds remaining. Everyone
 knew A&amp;M was done for. But the Aggies staged a stunning rally, sending=
 the game into overtime, where they came out on top. Fans &#8212; particula=
rly those in Iowa &#8212; learned then that victory can be elusive even whe=
n it looks certain. Ted Cruz, who like the Aggies
 is from Texas, needs a dramatic surprise to have a real chance of winning =
the Republican nomination for president. But at least until Indiana votes o=
n Tuesday, it's too early to assume Donald Trump has the nomination wrapped=
 up. Plenty of observers, of course,
 are eager to pronounce him the GOP winner so they can get on to obsessing =
about the general election. Trump himself, with a comfortable lead in the I=
