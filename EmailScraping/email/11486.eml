April and Luis,
Greetings from the new gig! I hope you're both well. You knew it wouldn't
be long before I came calling given the season we're in.
Both with the near-nomination of Trump and likely nomination of Secretary
Clinton, I want to make sure Senator Cardin is on your radar as a foreign
policy surrogate for upcoming press calls and events, and as we look ahead
to the Convention, both from a platform and day-to-day programming
perspective, I wanted to know how he and his team can be publicly and
privately involved in helping shape.
With the foreign apprehension we're hearing about a potential Trump
presidency and with our own likely nominee a former Secretary of State, we
know this topic will likely get a lot more attention than other elections.
Just a note for now to let you know we're looking ahead and want to be on
your radar.
CC'd here is Sue Walitsky, Senator Cardin's personal office communications
director.
Thanks and see you both soon hopefully.
Sean
