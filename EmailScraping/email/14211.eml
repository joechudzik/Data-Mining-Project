DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz

Remarks - Swing State Blue Gala

May 21th, 2016 | 7-10 minutes

Intro



Hello Florida Democrats! It's great to get away from Washington to be with you tonight here in my home state!



Thank you, Allison, for the invitation to join you tonight and for that kind introduction.



Recognize:

[Allison Tant]

[Senator Bill Nelson]

[DNC Members]

[Elected Representatives]



And it's also wonderful to be here with one of our Party's youngest, most accomplished stars - Secretary Julian Castro.



He's earned that reputation for good reason. Few people are as tireless in standing up and fighting for what we believe as Democrats.



In fact, he was kind enough to join us at a DNC-sponsored Hispanic Summit back in March in Miami - a fantastic opportunity to engage South Florida's thriving Hispanic community, listen to their ideas for the future of our party and hear about the great work they're doing to organize and mobilize voters.



Their personal stories were a real reminder that politics is about people, their hopes and aspirations; and a reminder that for Democrats, our diversity is our strength.



That's something I know Secretary Castro understands and he brings that understanding every day to his work in President Barack Obama's Administration.



What's at Stake



We've got 170 days until we elect the next great Democrat to the Oval Office on Election Day - Just 170 days to make sure every eligible voter in Florida understands what's at stake.



Remember, when the last Republican president left office, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month; Foreclosure signs dotted too many streets; millions of people lacked health care.



And now the GOP is about to nominate someone who thinks those were the good old days.



In fact, in 2006, Trump said he hoped for a housing market crash - Why? To take advantage of cheap prices and enrich himself.



In just the last week, the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump has backpedaled away from his own pledge to release his tax returns, vowed to slash taxes for those at the top like himself, and seemingly lied about pretending to be his own publicist.



He refused to address his well-documented history of misogyny and insulted one of our country's most important allies, Great Britain, and he legitimized a despotic North Korean dictator.



His campaign called their selection of a white supremacist delegate a 'database error.'



I don't know about you, but it didn't exactly put me at ease either, when Trump suggested we could always resolve debt by printing more money.,



Every day there's a new example of his knee-jerk recklessness, lack of judgment and unstable temperament.



But we cannot gloss over the genuine concern that, as President Obama has said, too many Americans are still feeling worried about their own pocketbooks and our place in the world.



That's why your support of the Florida Democratic Party is so crucial.

I know the State Party is doing everything possible to bring people into the general election energized, understanding what's at stake, and championing the values and priorities that make our party and our country great.



But they can't do it without your help.



What Democratic Leadership Means



I am confident that the passion and energy from our primary will be united in a common purpose-to move forward the ideals of our party and keep the White House out of Donald Trump's hands.



Nearly 23 million people have participated in our primaries and both campaigns have advanced real ideas that will improve the lives of Americans. Supporters of both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders deserve our respect for the work they have put into their campaigns.



At the end of the day, it is YOUR leadership that will help build unity and drive enthusiasm. Enthusiasm then drives turnout, turnout wins the election.


And at times like these, when the work is hard, and passions run hot and the road looks long, we need to take a step back and remember what we're doing this for and why.



How many of you remember eight years ago, Ted Kennedy took the stage of what would be his last Democratic National Convention in Denver?



He was a man no doubt tired from his year-long personal battle with cancer, burdened by the terrible weight of a terminal prognosis.



But that's not what we saw. We saw the courage of a man whose uncompromising convictions lifted him up to transcend his personal pain and speak with the purest passion about our shared ideals.



He spoke about a new hope for the cause of his life - universal health care. <pause>



This week, in the midst of the media's love affair with notions of party discord, we marked the first time in our nation's history that more than 90% of Americans have access to affordable healthcare.



Ninety Percent. The number doesn't do justice to what it represents - the diseases and cancers cured, wounds healed, lives extended, comfort for the dying and peace for families.



It was the cause of Ted Kennedy's life, but it wasn't his accomplishment alone. It's not the accomplishment of the Congress that passed the Affordable Care Act or President Barack Obama and the stroke of his pen.



This is our accomplishment. It's a Democratic Party accomplishment.



Because of Democratic leadership, 20 million Americans have health insurance who didn't before. We've seen 74 straight months of private sector job growth creating over 14 million new jobs.



Conclusion - Introduce Convention Video



We remember the Great Recession.



WE ARE NOT GOING BACK by allowing a Trump presidency.



We are in a fight together to make our country stronger once again - to expand opportunity for all, level the playing field, raise wages, and give everyone a fair shot regardless of where they come from.



By working together as Democrats, we can accomplish great things for honest, hard-working people from every walk of life. We can set and pass an agenda that promotes economic growth, fairness and opportunity.



Yes, fellow Democrats: America's future is bright. When we stick together, anything is possible.



I'm excited for the future of our party, I'm excited to show the American people what a unified Democratic party looks like at our convention, and I'm proud of your work that will carry us forward into a brighter future.



Now it's my great pleasure to introduce a little "video appetizer" to get everyone hungry for our upcoming National Convention in the great city of Philadelphia -



When the nation looks at our convention, they'll see a portrait of America.



Our Party Affairs and Delegate Selection team has worked tirelessly to ensure that every state party has an accessible and inclusive process for anyone to run to become a delegate. Whether it's a school teacher in Orlando, a plumber in Cleveland, or a high school student in Denver, our convention delegates will reflect the diversity our Party.



And when we pick our nominee, we will not stop fighting to elect Democrats up and down the ballot until Election Day!



Thank you, enjoy, and on to VICTORY!!!
