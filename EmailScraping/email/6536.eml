Segment 1

Montage of what happened in politics this week. Showing the terrible headli=
nes about how Trump's nomination killed the Republican Party and all the pr=
ominent Republicans coming out against Trump. Some clips of the Trump inter=
view:

What will you tell Paul Ryan?

Will tell him this is what the people want. Have had so much support from a=
ll the people Paul Ryan works with, congressmen are endorsing him in waves =
now. Doesn't care if Lindsey Graham supports him.

Was very surprised and very disappointed in Ryan.

The party doesn't necessarily have to be unified. It would be better if it =
were, but doesn't think it actually has to be unified in the traditional se=
nse.

I am a conservative but don't forget that this is called the Republican Par=
ty, not the Conservative Party.

On Jeb Bush not endorsing him -

Trump doesn't blame him, says if he were Jeb he probably wouldn't vote for =
himself either.

Are you worried about Obama out there campaigning against you?

Thinks it could be a good thing down the road.

On his comments about women -

A lot of it was said in his role as an entertainer because he had the Appre=
ntice or some was said in fun situations like the Howard Stern show. He is =
not worried about those past clips coming back to haunt him because he was =
just saying what everyone else thinks.

What politicians say behind the scenes is far worse than anything Trump has=
 said or will ever say.

HRC is a baby - just look what happens with her family. Take a look at her =
husband, how do you think he talks to women? She is playing the women's car=
d so loudly.

There was an article about Melania in GQ this week and you said that spouse=
s should be kept out of it. Do you think Bill Clinton should be off the tab=
le?

It depends on how involved he is in the campaign. He gets involved when she=
 plays the women card.

Melania was a very successful model and now she just wants to be a homemake=
r. She is a very good woman.

Round Table: Matt Dowd, Rich Lowry, Donna Brazille, Alex Castellanos, Katri=
na Vanden Heuvel

Can this feud between Ryan and Trump be healed?

Dowd: the breach is between the GOP elite and GOP voters. The voters have s=
poken and have said Donald Trump represents their party. Donald Trump isn't=
 the problem for the GOP elite, the voters are the problem.

Castellanos: It is going to be up to Trump to realize that Paul Ryan is the=
 future of the GOP. Trump isn't running as a party guy, he has no vision ar=
ound which to rally the party.

Lowry: Ryan rightfully expressed disgust at how many Republicans immediatel=
y got on board with Trump with no questions asked.

Donna: Ryan has been at least one of the Republicans who have spoken out ag=
ainst the kind of bigotry Trump is embracing.

Katrina: we are seeing the crack up of the party because the elites have no=
t delivered for the base. Trump is like the Republicans frankenstein with o=
range hair. The Republican Party is reaping what they sowed. This is a part=
y which has continually exploited what Trump is now exploiting - dog whistl=
e racism.

Dowd: what party is Paul Ryan the future of? The Party says we want to ban =
muslims and build a wall, that is what they are now. Paul Ryan is the futur=
e but it is a future that is of a dinosaur party that is gone.

How can Paul Ryan come around to Trump if Trump continues to embrace the Mu=
slim ban and the deportation of immigrants?

Lowry: Going to be very hard. Trump does not like foreign trade, foreign na=
tions including our allies, foreign interventions, or foreigners when they =
come here.

Gary Johnson interview

Said he thought he would take as much from Clinton as he would from Trump.
Glad he is being added to the polls.

Legalizing marijuana would make the world a better place.
Safer alternative to other substances.
The war on drugs has taken a huge human toll.

Who would he choose between Hillary or Trump?
-he=92d always vote libertarian.

I missed the beginning of the Trump interview but came in when he was argui=
ng that his tax plan will be negotiated and not look like what he put out. =
He claimed it would be a boon for the middle class and raise his taxes. We =
could/maybe should do a hit on  this. Sounded like he didn=92t know his own=
 plan.


On a Fox panel one of the commentators (Kim something?) hit Trump for chang=
ing his mind on his tax plan this week.

He was asked about his flip flop on the minimum wage and he said he was ope=
n to changing it but he really wanted to bring jobs where people could earn=
 more.

He was asked how he could keep Carrier and other companies here when the pr=
oducts for the Trump Collection aren=92t made in the US. He said that the i=
tems for his collection aren=92t made here and didn=92t think it was hypocr=
itical=85.


There is probably more from this interview so someone should take a second =
look.
