Dejuana,

I have not received a request for an op-ed, however, the Joe Madison show on Sirius XM asked if she would be available for an interview tomorrow morning. I reached out to her to see if she was interested and available.

Please excuse me as I am caught off guard by this email. Am I supposed to speak with you before going to Virgie Rollins? 

Best,
Deshundra
