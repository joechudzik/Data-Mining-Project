OK (and, also, hello Dan).

I expect to be able to fill out those 6 seats soon but there are several =
=E2=80=9Cnegotiations=E2=80=9D that need to be worked out first.  #1 =
being between me and my wife (who is I spoke to at the Ottawa (!) =
airport a few hours ago and who is not yet home and with whom some diffs =
of opinion need to be worked out.  (Long story).  BUT (since I am =
certain we are giving the MAX) I cannot imagine we won=E2=80=99t want 6 =
seats.  The question of WHO those people are is the main question. =20

Anyway =E2=80=94 please hold 6 seats until tomorrow afternoon and I =
expect that tomorrow afternoon I=E2=80=99ll be willing to guarantee 6 =
FILLED seats (even if I don=E2=80=99t have all the names yet).
