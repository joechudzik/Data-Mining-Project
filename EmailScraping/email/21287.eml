Ken -

I hope you're having a wonderful trip, and apologies for interrupting.

I wanted to let you know that we've recruited a few folks on our end as
follows:

   - Stacey & Jeff Weber gave $46,800 to attend as cohosts (this also
   qualifies them for a convention package, which I am happy to discuss)
   - David & Ruth Levine are each doing their general max ($33,400 each)
   for a total of 6 spots and change ($6,800 to be exact).
   - Kate Whitney & Franklin Thomas will be attending as cohosts ($33,400).
   - Eric Schoenberg has agreed to attend and contribute for at least 2
   seats, but is considering doing more to qualify for a convention package.
   - Ed Zimmerman is a likely attendee - I believe you know him

This puts us at 16 seats on our side. Given the success we've had with the
little outreach we've done, we will stand down and let Lauren get the
invitations out to your folks. This puts us at 26 total attendees including
the ones you sent, and a committed total of $362,000.

I know I spoke with Lauren yesterday and she was getting the list ready, so
will revert back with RSVPs as they come in. If you have any questions in
the interim, please don't hesitate to reach out.

All my best,
Zach
