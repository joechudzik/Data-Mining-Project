Scott and Christy will do one Max out (33,4K) in about two weeks and likely=
 two total at that time. One should be definite. They're in South Africa fo=
r two more weeks. Scott called me back from Cape Town this morning.=20

Anyone I should not call right now, outside of the obvious that are in both=
 of your universes?=20

Are we still hammering for April deadline or setting up for May? =20

Calling Benter again among others! =20

Thanks!
