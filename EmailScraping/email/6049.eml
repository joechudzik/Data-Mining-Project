THE HILL // VICKI NEEDHAM

The White House is developing a plan to pass a sweeping Pacific Rim trade d=
eal in Congress this year. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday=
 that Obama administration officials have been in touch with congressional =
Democrats and Republicans who are supportive of the Trans-Pacific Partnersh=
ip (TPP) to "develop a legislative strategy for moving forward." "We're goi=
ng to continue to consult about the best path forward and we would like to =
see Congress act soon to approve the agreement," Earnest told reporters. Ea=
rnest said that the White House is pushing for a vote in Congress before th=
e lame-duck session after the November elections. "And the case that we hav=
e made is consistent with the argument that the Chamber of Commerce and oth=
er influential Republican-leaning organizations have made, which is that ev=
ery day that goes by is a missed opportunity for American businesses and Am=

President Barack Obama is still grappling with a historic decision on wheth=

Judge quotes movies to rebuke Justice Dept. lawyers in Obama immigration ca=

POLITICO // SEUNG MIN KIM

A federal judge slapped an extraordinarily unusual order on Justice Departm=
ent lawyers on Thursday, saying they misled him about details of President =
Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration, ordering up names of certa=
in immigrants here illegally and calling on the administration's attorneys =
to take a legal ethics course every year. In a sternly-worded order, U.S. D=
istrict Judge Andrew Hanen argued that lawyers for the Obama administration=
 were intentionally deceptive when they discussed how many work permits had=
 been issued under Obama's November 2014 immigration directive. The Supreme=
 Court is currently weighing the legality of Obama's actions. "The miscondu=
ct in this case was intentional, serious and material," Hanen wrote in the =
28-page order filed Thursday. "In fact, it is hard to imagine a more seriou=
s, more calculated plan of unethical conduct." At issue is a batch of work =
permits issued by the Obama administration to certain immigrants without le=
gal status shortly before Hanen handed down his order blocking the implemen=
tation of Obama's controversial executive actions. All together, Obama's ac=

U.S. lawmakers on Thursday began coalescing around revised bipartisan legis=

Looking ahead to the general election in November, Donald Trump trails both=

ightly narrower margins than last month. Hillary Clinton now holds a six-po=
int lead over Donald Trump, down from 10 points a month ago. Trump trails B=

 have been engaged in battles over taxes almost every year from the late 19=

NEW YORK TIMES // THE EDITORIAL BOARD

Nobody should be surprised when the present House of Representatives, domin=
ated by penurious reactionaries, produces a stingy response to a danger tha=
t calls for compassionate largess. But for sheer fecklessness it's hard to =
top the House's response this week to the Zika virus. The salient feature i=
s that in providing money to fight one health menace, it steals from other =
funds meant to fight an even more dangerous threat - the Ebola virus. In Fe=
bruary, President Obama asked Congress for $1.9 billion to help fight Zika,=
 a virus that can cause severe birth defects and has been linked to neurolo=
gical disorders in adults. Transmittable by mosquitoes and through sex, Zik=
a broke out last year in Brazil and has since spread to the United States a=
nd other countries. Experts fear there could eventually be hundreds of thou=
sands of infections in Puerto Rico, where nearly half the population lives =
below the poverty line, with possibly hundreds of babies affected. States i=
n the American South with large mosquito populations are also at particular=
 risk. On Thursday, the Senate voted for $1.1 billion in emergency funds fo=
r research, vaccine development, mosquito control efforts and other program=
s. The bill does not provide as much money as public health agencies like t=

Overdue change in overtime pay: Our view<http://www.usatoday.com/story/opin=

USA TODAY // THE EDITORIAL BOARD

For most people, a salaried job paying $25,000 a year is far from exception=
al. It corresponds to an hourly wage of roughly $14, which isn't enough to =
live on in many pricey metro areas. But, according to existing federal labo=
r rules, a $25,000 job can be classified as managerial or given another des=
ignation that exempts it from overtime pay. That's why the Obama administra=
tion moved this week to change those rules. As of Dec. 1, the minimum annua=
l salary that can be excluded from overtime will be raised from $23,660 to =
$47,476, unless opponents manage to block the change in Congress or the cou=
rts. The move is long overdue. The percentage of people eligible for overti=
me has been in a free fall since its high in 1975. Then, 62% of salaried wo=
rkers were paid overtime for work over 40 hours. Today the number is 7%. An=
d it was even lower before 2004, when the Bush administration made some nee=

IN A badly broken Washington, even small victories for normal governmental =

is obvious and urgent, given Puerto Rico's insolvency, its $2 billion debt =
payment due in July and the lack of any bankruptcy-like mechanism for resol=

31 deadline for action by the House - only to be thwarted by an effective, =
but not very transparent, lobbying effort led by hedge funds with an intere=
st in blocking restructuring of Puerto Rican bonds they bought at fire-sale=
 prices. Taking to the airwaves with hyperbolic warnings of an impending ta=

WASHINGTON POST // THE EDITORIAL BOARD

IN THEIR push to repeal a measure giving D.C. the right to spend its own ta=
x dollars, House Republicans repeatedly sounded the argument that the Const=
itution gives Congress "supreme authority" over the District. They are righ=
t about that power. But that doesn't answer why a party that professes to c=
hampion local control and abhor government overreach would choose to underm=
ine self-government in an American city that is home to 700,000 people. The=
 illogic, even by Washington standards, is stunning. The House Oversight an=
d Government Reform Committee voted along party lines this week to advance =
a bill that would nullify budget autonomy for the District. D.C. voters ove=
rwhelmingly approved budget autonomy in a 2013 referendum. The measure, tho=
ugh subject to differing legal interpretations, has been upheld in court. M=
oreover, before it went into effect, Congress had an opportunity to overtur=

The misconduct in this case was intentional,

quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan on Thursday became the l=
atest state leader to sign contentious legislation restricting civil asset =
forfeiture &#8212; the process that allows police to seize and
 keep property suspected of being connected to illegal activity without hav=
ing to convict, or even charge, the owner with a crime. Hogan&#8217;s signa=
ture represents a stark reversal for the Republican governor, who, under pr=
essure from high-profile law enforcement
 groups, vetoed a bill on the same subject last year. The General Assembly =
promptly overrode the veto to pass that measure and then introduced additio=
nal changes this year that limit state involvement in a federal forfeiture =
program and require authorities
 to report what they seize. Widespread civil forfeiture has been controvers=
ial since becoming a key tool in the drug war in the 1980s. The back-and-fo=
rth in Maryland is part of a fresh round of battles being waged in statehou=
ses nationwide because Congress
 has stalled on passing federal reforms &#8212; though a new federal measur=
e was introduced Thursday.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 a USA TODAY analysis found Trump&#8217;s businesses have been involved in

March, the analysis of court cases, property

 companies were issued warrants totaling more than $13,000 for late or unpa=
id taxes in New York state just since Trump declared his candidacy in June =
2015, according to state records.
 This spring, as Trump flew to campaign rallies around the country aboard h=
is trademark private jet, the state of New York filed a tax warrant to try =
to collect $8,578 in unpaid taxes from the Trump-owned company that owns th=
e Boeing 757. The company has since
 paid that tax bill. As recently as last week, Trump said he was &#8220;wil=

 will go up somewhat&#8221; if he becomes president. But the lawsuits and o=

quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Nobody should be surprised when the present House =
of Representatives, dominated by penurious reactionaries, produces a stingy=
 response to a danger that calls for compassionate largess.
 But for sheer fecklessness it&#8217;s hard to top the House&#8217;s respon=
se this week to the Zika virus. The salient feature is that in providing mo=
ney to fight one health menace, it steals from other funds meant to fight a=
n even more dangerous threat &#8212; the Ebola virus.
 In February, President Obama asked Congress for $1.9 billion to help fight=
 Zika, a virus that can cause severe birth defects and has been linked to n=
eurological disorders in adults. Transmittable by mosquitoes and through se=
x, Zika broke out last year in Brazil
 and has since spread to the United States and other countries. Experts fea=
r there could eventually be hundreds of thousands of infections in Puerto R=
ico, where nearly half the population lives below the poverty line, with po=
ssibly hundreds of babies affected.
 States in the American South with large mosquito populations are also at p=
articular risk. On Thursday, the Senate voted for $1.1 billion in emergency=
 funds for research, vaccine development, mosquito control efforts and othe=
r programs. The bill does not provide
 as much money as public health agencies like the Centers for Disease Contr=
ol and Prevention say they need, but it is a decent start.<o:p></o:p></span=

quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">For most people, a salaried job paying $25,000 a y=
ear is far from exceptional. It corresponds to an hourly wage of roughly $1=
4, which isn&#8217;t enough to live on in many pricey metro areas.
 But, according to existing federal labor rules, a $25,000 job can be class=
ified as managerial or given another designation that exempts it from overt=
ime pay. That's why the Obama administration moved this week to change thos=
e rules. As of Dec. 1, the minimum
 annual salary that can be excluded from overtime will be raised from $23,6=
60 to $47,476, unless opponents manage to block the change in Congress or t=
he courts. The move is long overdue. The percentage of people eligible for =
overtime has been in a free fall
 since its high in 1975. Then, 62% of salaried workers were paid overtime f=
or work over 40 hours. Today the number is 7%. And it was even lower before=

quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">IN A badly broken Washington, even small victories=
 for normal governmental process count as cause for celebration. Consider T=
hursday&#8217;s agreement between House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.)
 and the Obama administration on a measure to help Puerto Rico out of its d=
ebt crisis. The need for legislation is obvious and urgent, given Puerto Ri=
co&#8217;s insolvency, its $2 billion debt payment due in July and the lack=
 of any bankruptcy-like mechanism for
 resolving the situation under existing law. That&#8217;s why Mr. Ryan had =
set a March 31 deadline for action by the House &#8212; only to be thwarted=
 by an effective, but not very transparent, lobbying effort led by hedge fu=
nds with an interest in blocking restructuring
 of Puerto Rican bonds they bought at fire-sale prices. Taking to the airwa=
ves with hyperbolic warnings of an impending taxpayer &#8220;bailout,&#8221=
; these interests helped distort and delay House work on a bill, pushing Pu=
erto Rico and its beleaguered populace right
 to the edge of financial collapse &#8212; and a possible humanitarian cris=
is.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">IN THEIR push to repeal a measure giving D.C. the =
right to spend its own tax dollars, House Republicans repeatedly sounded th=
e argument that the Constitution gives Congress &#8220;supreme
 authority&#8221; over the District. They are right about that power. But t=
hat doesn&#8217;t answer why a party that professes to champion local contr=

 in an American city that is home to 700,000
 people. The illogic, even by Washington standards, is stunning. The House =
Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted along party lines this week=
 to advance a bill that would nullify budget autonomy for the District. D.C=
. voters overwhelmingly approved
 budget autonomy in a 2013 referendum. The measure, though subject to diffe=
ring legal interpretations, has been upheld in court. Moreover, before it w=
ent into effect, Congress had an opportunity to overturn it but instead cho=
se not to act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
