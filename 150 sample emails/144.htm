		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://www.torproject.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://www.torproject.org/'" tppabs="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://tails.boum.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://tails.boum.org/'" tppabs="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://tails.boum.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://tails.boum.org/'" tppabs="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://www.couragefound.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://www.couragefound.org/'" tppabs="https://www.couragefound.org/">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<div class="onion-url">wlupld3ptjvsgwqw.onion</div>
			<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

THE BIG IDEA by Karen Tumulty &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6639045.60118/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9rdHVtdWx0eT93cG1tPTEmd3Bpc3JjPW5sX2RhaWx5MjAy/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1Ca19bd556&gt;:

James Hohmann is on vacation -- we'll have a series of guest writers from the Post political team sharing their analysis with you this week.

Donald Trump is already referring to himself as the “presumptive nominee.” And if the results of tonight's Indiana primary go as the polling suggests they will, many others could be saying the same thing tomorrow morning. He may emerge well positioned to have the 1,237 delegates to close the deal on the first ballot at the GOP convention in Cleveland this summer.

So what would a Trump-Clinton matchup look like this fall? As our colleague Dan Balz notes &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6639045.60118/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL3RoZS1xdWVzdGlvbi1vZi10aGUtbW9tZW50LXdoYXQtd2lsbC10cnVtcC1iZS1saWtlLWFzLWdvcC1ub21pbmVlLzIwMTYvMDUvMDIvMjFiNWYwNWMtMGU0NS0xMWU2LWJmYTEtNGVmYTg1NmNhZjJhX3N0b3J5Lmh0bWw_aHBpZD1ocF9yaHAtdG9wLXRhYmxlLW1haW5fdHJ1bXAtZ2VuZXJhbC0xMDMwYTpob21lcGFnZS9zdG9yeSZ3cG1tPTEmd3Bpc3JjPW5sX2RhaWx5MjAy/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C70ea91d2&gt;, it is hard to imagine Trump  changing his combative, unpredictable style

He plastered his opponents with nicknames – “Lyin’ Ted,” and “Little Marco” – that have helped define them.

“He always counterattacks ferociously. He also finds a way to define his opponent in a way that shrinks and limits them. These aren’t just barroom brawl tactics. They are to define semantically his opponents in ways they can’t get out of, Hillary being the next great experiment,” former House speaker Newt Gingrich told Balz.

But in Clinton, Trump is up against a known quantity. She has high negatives, and Team Trump insists that the potential is there to make them go up even more. But voters have had more than a quarter-century to make up their minds about her.

Will they believe his jibes about her stamina? Can he convince voters that she is, as he put it, “Incompetent Hillary”? Will “Crooked Hillary” sound like old news? Will his allusions to Bill Clinton’s past marital infidelities stick, coming from a man whose own life has been a staple of a New York tabloids going back to the 1980s?

Moreover, Clinton has built a massive political infrastructure to deal with the onslaught.

The celebrity billionaire, for the first time, may be at a disadvantage in that regard. “Donald Trump does not have one finance chairman in one state. It’s amazing,” Stuart Stevens told me. Stevens was a top strategist for 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney and who is a persistent Trump critic. “He’s about to walk into a $1-billion buzzsaw.”

And he may take other Republicans there with him, as previewed by a new ad  &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6639045.60118/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvcG9zdC1wb2xpdGljcy93cC8yMDE2LzA1LzAyL3NoZS1hdGUtbGlrZS1hLXBpZy1hcmthbnNhcy1zZW5hdGUtY2FuZGlkYXRlLXVzZXMtdHJ1bXBzLXJlbWFya3MtYWJvdXQtd29tZW4tYWdhaW5zdC1vcHBvbmVudC8_d3BtbT0xJndwaXNyYz1ubF9kYWlseTIwMg/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1Cc4f3f1f9&gt;in the Arkansas Senate race, in which Democratic challenger Conner Eldridge seeks to tie GOP incumbent John Boozman to a series of inflammatory comments that Trump has made about women. 

What Democrats say worries them most about Trump in the fall is his sheer unpredictability, and the degree to which he represents something larger that is going on in the electorate.

While polls suggest Clinton would win handily against Trump, she also must pick her shots carefully.

“Given the anti-status quo environment in the country, Democrats need to prepare for a close and competitive general election against Donald Trump, and it would be a mistake to underestimate Trump or presume he cannot win in November,” said Geoff Garin, a top strategist in Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign who now works with the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA.

David Axelrod, who was President Obama’s top political adviser, told the 202: “She has to be disdainful of him, without being disdainful of the people who support him.”

Conner Eldridge for U.S. Senate - "Harassment"

INDIANA PRIMARY TONIGHT IS MAKE-OR-BREAK FOR CRUZ:

If Cruz loses big, as the polls suggest &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6639045.60118/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmNuZXdzLmNvbS9tZWV0LXRoZS1wcmVzcy9kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXAtbGVhZHMtY3J1ei0xNS1wb2ludHMtY3J1Y2lhbC1pbmRpYW5hLXJhY2UtbjU2NTM1Nj93cG1tPTEmd3Bpc3JjPW5sX2RhaWx5MjAy/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1Da4b6b144&gt;, it could dramatically change the GOP race. The Texas senator's path to the GOP nod becomes even narrower: 

-- This was supposed to be the Midwestern state that would deny Trump the delegates he needs to secure the Republican nomination. But now, Indiana appears poised to help the front-runner get closer to locking it up. Philip Rucker, David Weigel and Sean Sullivan &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6639045.60118/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL3RydW1wLXNlZXMtYS1kZWNpc2l2ZS1pbmRpYW5hLXZpY3RvcnktYXQtaGFuZC1nZWFycy11cC10by10YWtlLW9uLWNsaW50b24vMjAxNi8wNS8wMi9lYWEzOTJkYS0xMDcwLTExZTYtODFiNC01ODFhNWM0YzQyZGZfc3RvcnkuaHRtbD93cG1tPTEmd3Bpc3JjPW5sX2RhaWx5MjAy/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1Cc439d95e&gt; write that Trump has been buoyed in the state by two main forces:
The first is his populist messages about trade deals: Trump’s rallying cries against a “rigged” and “corrupt” political system have resonated in a state whose manufacturing economy is hollowing out. “All spring, Trump has hammered Carrier for shuttering its Indianapolis furnace factory and relocating to Mexico — a plant closing that has gotten considerable local news attention.”   The second is his newfound “aura of inevitability”: “You cannot underestimate the impact that Trump winning all counties last week in the ‘Acela primary’ had on Indiana,” said GOP strategist Scott Reed. “A month ago, Cruz was leading Trump by 20 percent in Indiana. Trump’s wins, coupled with landing his plane in state, has driven voters into his column.”
--The New York Times's Alexander Burns notes: &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6639045.60118/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzA1LzAzL3VzL3BvbGl0aWNzL2luZGlhbmEtcHJpbWFyeS5odG1sP2hwJmFjdGlvbj1jbGljayZwZ3R5cGU9SG9tZXBhZ2UmY2xpY2tTb3VyY2U9c3RvcnktaGVhZGluZyZtb2R1bGU9Zmlyc3QtY29sdW1uLXJlZ2lvbiZyZWdpb249dG9wLW5ld3MmV1QubmF2PXRvcC1uZXdzJl9yPTAmd3BtbT0xJndwaXNyYz1ubF9kYWlseTIwMg/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1Cb75a08a0&gt; "The Indiana vote has emerged as a decisive and perhaps final test for Senator Ted Cruz, who has abandoned hope of overtaking Mr. Trump in the race but still aims to throw the Republican nominating fight to a contested convention in July ... Mr. Cruz has signaled that he intends to forge ahead irrespective of the outcome in Indiana ... He spent part of the weekend campaigning in California, which is among the last states to vote, on June 7, and collected the endorsement of former Gov. Pete Wilson, who warned that Mr. Trump would doom the party as its nominee. But Mr. Wilson conceded in an interview on Monday that a defeat in Indiana would imperil Mr. Cruz’s path forward. To win California, Mr. Wilson said, 'the first thing he needs to do is win in Indiana.'"

Meanwhile, in a telling moment, Cruz came face-to-face with the forces working against him outside a campaign stop in Marion, where Trump supporters were heckling him from across the street: “Cruz approached and engaged the demonstrators. One of them told him, ‘Indiana don’t want you.’ ‘Sir, America is a better country —‘ Cruz said, at which point the man interrupted to say: ‘Without you.’” See the exchange below:

On the eve of Indiana’s vote … Trump spent his final day of campaigning here looking ahead to November — touting general election polling, lunching with a prominent Clinton gadfly, and making the case that the Republican nominating contest is all but over. ‘The people of Indiana are going to put me over the top and we can focus on Hillary Clinton,’ Trump told supporters at the Century Center here Monday evening, moving past Cruz and Kasich. At a stop earlier in the day, in Carmel, Trump ran out of ways to make the point. ‘If we win Indiana it’s over. They’re finished. They’re finished. They’re gone,’ he said. ‘They have no path, whereas I have a very easy path.’”

Important to national Republicans: The Indiana Senate primary is also tonight. House GOPers Marlin Stutzman and Todd Young are facing off in what has been a nasty campaign to replace retiring Sen.

POLLING ROUNDUP:

-- Republicans see their nominating contest as all but wrapped up, with 91 percent of GOP voters saying they believe Trump will be the party nominee, according to a CNN/ORC poll. &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6639045.60118/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm4uY29tLzIwMTYvMDUvMDIvcG9saXRpY3MvY25uLW9yYy1wb2xsLWhpbGxhcnktY2xpbnRvbi1kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXAvP3dwbW09MSZ3cGlzcmM9bmxfZGFpbHkyMDI/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C7e0eb002&gt;
39 percent of voters said they would be “enthusiastic” if Trump won the party nomination, compared to 21 percent for Cruz and 16 percent for John Kasich. More voters also reported they would be “dissatisfied or upset” with Cruz or Kasich winning the nomination than Trump.   And for GOP voters NOT backing Trump, nearly half said the real estate mogul is their “backup candidate”: 43 percent listed Trump as their second choice, with nearly a third choosing Cruz or Kasich. 15 percent said their choice is someone other than the remaining candidates.

CRUZ-FIORINA FLOPPING:

--“Carly, we hardly knew ye,” Post columnist Dana Milbank &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6639045.60118/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL29waW5pb25zL3RoZS1pbXBsb3Npb24tb2YtdGVkLWNydXovMjAxNi8wNS8wMi8yNzBjYjVjMi0xMDk4LTExZTYtODk2Ny03YWM3MzNjNTZmMTJfc3RvcnkuaHRtbD90aWQ9cG1fcG9wX2Imd3BtbT0xJndwaXNyYz1ubF9kYWlseTIwMg/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C834499f6&gt; quipped: “In a case of exceptionally bad timing, Fiorina hitched herself to Cruz at precisely the moment his candidacy began to implode … It’s not Fiorina’s fault that news broke just after her ‘nomination’ was announced that former House Speaker Boehner … had called Cruz ‘Lucifer in the flesh.’ Nor was it Fiorina’s fault that Indiana Gov. Mike Pence on Friday gave Cruz such a tepid endorsement … But if Fiorina picked investments the way she picked her candidate, you can see why HP stopped requiring her services. She bought Cruz at the peak, when polls showed him close in Indiana.” Milkbank also pans Fiorina's singing.

-- And a Morning Consult   poll s &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6639045.60118/aHR0cHM6Ly9tb3JuaW5nY29uc3VsdC5jb20vMjAxNi8wNS9wb2xsLWZpb3JpbmEtZG9lcy1saXR0bGUtdG8tY2hhbmdlLWNydXpzLXN1cHBvcnQtYW1vbmctZ29wLz93cG1tPTEmd3Bpc3JjPW5sX2RhaWx5MjAy/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C35ae11d3&gt;hows Fiorina did little to move the needle in Cruz’s favor, with 25 percent of GOP voters saying Fiorina made them more likely to vote for Cruz, while 24 percent said less likely. Her addition did virtually nothing to bolster Cruz's support among Republican women: 21 percent said of female voters said they were more likely to vote for Cruz, 20 percent said less likely.

-- Fiorina’s own favorability ratings have hardly increased since she conceded her own presidential bid in February, giving further credence to the notion that Cruz’s announcement was both hasty and ill-planned:
Today, 41 percent of GOP voters have a favorable view of Fiorina, up just five points from when she suspended her campaign. Her unfavorable ratings have remained unchanged at 36 percent.

But in a cruel twist for Cruz, who was gaining on Republican front-runner Donald Trump just weeks ago, Fiorina's unfortunate slip from the stage now looks like an apt metaphor for a campaign coming apart…”

-- Trump said he has more foreign policy experience than “virtually anybody”: The GOP front-runner claimed his experience building a global business empire has given him “more experience than virtually anybody looking at this office,” including former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. “Right now we have hundreds of deals being negotiated all over the world,” Trump said on CNN.  “I deal with presidents, I deal with prime ministers, I deal with everybody.” (Jenna Johnson &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6639045.60118/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvcG9zdC1wb2xpdGljcy93cC8yMDE2LzA1LzAyL2RvbmFsZC10cnVtcC1zYXlzLWhlLWhhcy1tb3JlLWZvcmVpZ24tcG9saWN5LWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtdGhhbi12aXJ0dWFsbHktYW55Ym9keS8_d3BtbT0xJndwaXNyYz1ubF9kYWlseTIwMg/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1Cf3438997&gt;)

The ad buy marks a shift in strategy for Trump’s campaign, which has declined to advertise advertising ahead of many contests this year.

-- Clinton outraised Sanders for the first time in months, with $26.4 million in primary donations compared to his $25.8 million. But the numbers have more to do with a drop-off in Sanders’s donations than a spike in Clinton's – the Vermont senator’s numbers dropped nearly 40 percent from March, reflecting his narrowing chances at becoming the party nominee.

-- Jane Sanders echoed her husband’s belief that the Democratic primary will end in a contested convention: “Neither Hillary nor Bernie will get the requisite number of pledged delegates to be able to wrap the nomination before the convention,” she told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes. “The fact is, it's not over until it's over.” (Washington Examiner &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6639045.60118/aHR0cDovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9uZXhhbWluZXIuY29tL2phbmUtc2FuZGVycy1ldm9rZXMteW9naS1iZXJyYS1pdHMtbm90LW92ZXItdW50aWwtaXRzLW92ZXIvYXJ0aWNsZS8yNTkwMTc5P3dwbW09MSZ3cGlzcmM9bmxfZGFpbHkyMDI/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C94f49e90&gt;)

Lately, though, it’s not so much about showing a vision as showing your work ... Trump has been far more forthcoming about his plans as a candidate than, say, his plans as a president. ‘I think Jeb would have been the nominee had I not gotten in,’ Trump told the New York Times. ‘But I was able to define Jeb early.’ After every election cycle there are books and symposiums by strategists offering their postmortem of what went right and what went wrong. In 2016, it happens in real time.

GOOD READS FROM ELSEWHERE:

-- The stakes are higher than ever for Cruz in Indiana, with a number of big donors threatening to abandon the “Stop Trump” effort that has spent millions on his behalf: From Politico’s Shane Goldmacher &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6639045.60118/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xpdGljby5jb20vc3RvcnkvMjAxNi8wNS9zdG9wLXRydW1wLXRvLWNydXotd2luLWluZGlhbmEtb3ItZWxzZS0yMjI3MjA_d3BtbT0xJndwaXNyYz1ubF9kYWlseTIwMg/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1Ce44c8a24&gt;: More than a half-dozen Republicans involved in the pro-Cruz, anti-Trump push said Indiana was crucial for Cruz to keeping the cash flowing, as “skittish donors have grown weary after a string of recent losses.” “If he can’t be stopped in Indiana, you will have a lot of [mega-donors] … who just throw up their arms and say, ‘Well, I guess he can’t be stopped,’” said Erick Erickson … “They’re not going to get on board Trump but they’re not going to continue to invest in what they perceive as a lost cause.”

Cruz has run through the entire political playbook to win Indiana. “He struck a nonaggression pact with Kasich. He bought TV ads. He blitzed the Sunday shows. He barnstormed the state on a bus tour. He got the governor’s endorsement. He even named his running mate … And if all that is not enough, it’s not clear what would be — both to anti-Trump donors, and to those inside his own campaign. "If we lose Indiana, we have to do some soul searching," said one top Cruz adviser, adding things are looking "rough right now."

HOT ON THE LEFT: 

“Supreme Court Delivers A Victory For Supporters Of Seattle’s Minimum Wage Law,” from HuffPost &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6639045.60118/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5odWZmaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vZW50cnkvc3VwcmVtZS1jb3VydC1zZWF0dGxlLW1pbmltdW0td2FnZV91c181NzI3NjdmYmU0YjAxYTVlYmRlNjE0Y2Q_dXRtX2hwX3JlZj1wb2xpdGljcyZ3cG1tPTEmd3Bpc3JjPW5sX2RhaWx5MjAy/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C088e8909&gt; : “The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a sweeping constitutional challenge to Seattle’s minimum wage law, in what could have been a test case for future legal attacks on similar measures across the country. In a one-line order, the justices declined to hear a case by the International Franchise Association and a group of Seattle franchisees, which had said in court papers that the city’s gradual wage increase to $15 discriminates against them in a way that violates the Constitution’s commerce clause.”
 
HOT ON THE RIGHT:

Though information about the terrorists is largely classified, defense officials have provided hints in the past.” "What I can tell you is, unfortunately, there have been Americans that have died because of detainees," said Paul Lewis, the Pentagon's special envoy for Guantanamo's closure.”
