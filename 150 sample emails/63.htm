		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://www.torproject.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://www.torproject.org/'" tppabs="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://tails.boum.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://tails.boum.org/'" tppabs="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://tails.boum.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://tails.boum.org/'" tppabs="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://www.couragefound.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://www.couragefound.org/'" tppabs="https://www.couragefound.org/">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<div class="onion-url">wlupld3ptjvsgwqw.onion</div>
			<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

Featuring Sarah Wheaton

BIG SENATE PRIMARIES TODAY: Ah yes, the classic clash of Establishment candidates and those pesky outsiders that just won't go away. In Maryland we've got Rep. Chris Van Hollen, with backing from Annapolis to Prince George's to Baltimore, vs. Rep. Donna Edwards, an upstart liberal contender that would be the second black female senator ever if she were to win election. And in Pennsylvania it's Katie McGinty, a former chief of staff to the governor, trying to ice her late-breaking lead against former Rep. Joe Sestak, a former Navy admiral who ironically doesn't really like taking orders from anyone. It's the most consequential day on the primary calendar yet for the Senate races, with the
 Pennsylvania race potentially shifting the battle for the Senate this fall. 

The narrative: But the intrigue goes beyond that. In a year of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, today will tell a key tale in whether voters care at all about who party honchos are trying to install in Senate seats. And if Sestak and Edwards win, the party's attempts at unity will determine just how big the insider-outsider connect is on the Democratic side. Sen. Joe Manchin, take it away: "We've been able to function dysfunctionally. Republicans haven't figured it out yet; they want to annihilate [ one another]. We've been able to figure out how to get through this and how to get back together. That's the difference." My story with Rachael Bade: 
http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9c916ccbf71d6941c38b7ef3c7322e7d9a7b2963142141b692ae43c84ea04be7

Joe Biden, aggressive surrogate: Great rollicking write-up on Vice President Joe Biden's work on Monday in Philadelphia for McGinty by Edward-Isaac Dovere. "I hope you'll look her over," Biden said to one couple. "If you don't, Bob Casey and I are going to come to your house." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9c916ccbf71d694114cb94a1a64dd315353793e5d0aacaf2ec94e9fec90f4cee

CHEETAHED OUT OF A BIG CAT: Lots of buzz about Sen. Jeff Flake and House Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce being on the Hill yesterday with an Australian shepherd and a cheetah, but not a ton of access. AP: "The House Foreign Affairs Committee brought a live cheetah to the Capitol on Monday, but news reporters and photographers were initially denied access to the big cat - the fastest land mammal in the world. 'This is a closed briefing,' said Cory Fritz, a spokesman for Rep. Ed Royce." Eventually, the committee doors opened. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9c916ccbf71d69417b45f3f62ff90950d69028831e5366c63585e7d375324b9c

Here's a great pic of of Flake and the beast: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9c916ccbf71d69410d9d503805c63a2a331dca45c799234a1546e39e7a7e9eaf

#HACTION BEEFS UP: Oh those conservative rabble rousers are GOING HAM this year. Heritage Action is spending more on lobbying than it ever has, per Roll Call, about $170,000 last quarter. "'There was a need to reach out and communicate directly with more offices on the Hill, really the entire Republican conference,' said Dan Holler, vice president of communications and government relations for the group. 'Having a direct line to all those offices is extremely important.'" Republican leaders are trying to contain their excitement. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9c916ccbf71d6941a923b127b0886ea03697ee0d74d7172dd18aff078525305c

CRUZ'S COLLEAGUES=DELEGATES: In the latest twist over how Ted Cruz's poor relationships with his colleagues could affect his presidential bid, lots of senators and members of Congress are starting to snag delegate spots at the Republican National Convention. And no, they won't commit to Cruz after the first ballot, Manu Raju reports for CNN. "In interviews with CNN, a wide range of lawmakers refused to say how they'd vote once most delegates are free to vote their conscience after a first round of balloting. 'Depending on how some decisions are going to be made, I could be part of helping the delegates as a whole make that decision' of selecting the nominee, [Sen. Thom] Tillis said. 'I'm
 legitimately uncommitted.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9c916ccbf71d694104362a95f779b2f763a19eec0866aa8354b3b1fc6a61cf49

GOOD TUESDAY. And welcome to the Huddle, your play-by-play guide to everything Capitol Hill, where exotic animals should be on display on a regular basis. Please send tips to beverett@politico.com and follow along on Twitter @burgessev. 

TODAY IN CONGRESS - The House is in at noon and will vote at 6:30 p.m. on some suspensions. The Senate is in at 10 a.m. and will vote at 11 a.m. on a trio of Appropriations amendments. 

AROUND THE HILL - At 9 a.m. Sens. Orrin Hatch and Patrick Leahy will speak about the Supreme Court at 9 a.m. in the Kennedy Caucus Room. At 9:30 a.m. Sen. Barbara Boxer leads a press conference on the Supreme Court steps to discuss how the vacancy affects the environment. At 11:30 p.m. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy holds a pen and pad in H-107. At 12:15 p.m. Sen. John McCain and MMA fighters discuss fighter safety research. At 1 p.m. Rep. Lloyd Doggett will be the keynote speaker at a Center for American Progress event on prescription drug prices at 1333 H St. NW. At 2 p.m. in Hart 902 Sen. Mark Kirk will give remarks at a briefing on Boko Haram and Islamic terrorism. 

REBOOTING THE FIGHT: Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Claire McCaskill will revive their push for the Campus Accountability Act to deal with sexual assault. There will be lots of Republican and Democratic senators in attendance at 11:30 a.m. in SVC-200. "Schools all across the country will routinely withhold a diploma if a student doesn't pay his fees. They'll kick a student out for cheating on a test. So where is the urgency when it comes to the violent crime of sexual assault? ... Most colleges are stuck in defensive mode, and won't even admit they have a problem because they're afraid their application numbers will drop or because they just don't take these assaults seriously ... We need to
 pass this bipartisan bill, and finally start holding our schools accountable for how they deal with this crime," Gillibrand will say at the event. 

MONDAY'S MOST CLICKED: Rand being Rand, yo. 

PROBABLY TUESDAY'S MOST CLICKED: Isaac snaps this shot of Biden really cozying up to a 93-year-old woman in Philly while on the trail for McGinty. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9c916ccbf71d6941422f389a3bb8f848a3a18aa0b81b49b46ea36b3610df3b41 

McCONNELL EYES FIRST APPROPS WIN: The Senate majority leader has set the Senate on course for finishing its water and energy funding bill this week, the first of 12 appropriations bills that McConnell is trying to finish this year to make a point about the Senate being back to work. There's not enough time to do all of them with all the recesses this year, but things are off to a better start than last year when the Democrats spiked a defense spending bill at the jump. "While the funding bill has managed to avoid partisan landmines in the Senate, it's garnered a veto threat from the White House," writes Jordain Carney for the Hill. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9c916ccbf71d6941ef59e45aa8651dd211aad40315fc617ce86f85533d41af3d

COVER ON GUN IMMUNITY:  Sen. Bernie Sanders' vote 11 years ago to give the firearms industry broad protections from liability has brought on a Sandy Hook guilt trip ahead of today's Democratic primary in Connecticut. But a new industry-commissioned poll shows broad support for the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. About 7 in 10 registered voters told Harper Polling they back the protections for the "law-abiding manufacturers and retailers of lawful products which get misused." About a quarter supported PLCAA repeal "because the current protection enables manufacturers and retailers to sell guns to people who shouldn't have them, because they know they cannot be sued and don't face
 any consequences." More than half of those who voted for Obama in 2012 back the existing law, and those identifying as "strong Democrats." Top lines: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9c916ccbf71d694192c5d9415aa57f9ec6472f1753c033e21985748defea720f

GOP TROUBLE IN COLORADO: The party's preferred Senate candidate, Jon Keyser, failed to qualify for the ballot -- and Sen. Michael Bennet seemed to be walking with a spring in his step on Monday evening. Denver Post: "Keyser fell short by 86 signatures in Colorado's 3rd District, according to the Colorado secretary of state's office, which reviewed his petition. The 3rd District is one of the state's largest and comprises most of western Colorado. Keyser's campaign plans to protest the decision and has five days to do so. The 16,067 signatures he submitted overall allowed him to clear the threshold in the six other districts." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9c916ccbf71d6941e9bcb9e6bc3cbced5ce272df25247138450ff891dca3707a

EVERYONE IS AN INSIDER! In response to Senate Majority PAC's ad against Sen. Rob Portman hitting him as a "Washington insider," Portman is out with a web ad flipping the attack on Gov. Ted Strickland and calling HIM a DC insider. The spot clips Strickland talking about running for Congress since the '70s and leaving Ohio for lobbying shops, concluding he's "everything that's wrong with Washington." You can watch that here first: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9c916ccbf71d69419e58b8d373d4d330c236061f39f125eeefc0329202f83869

NARAL HITS AYOTTE, ENDORSES HASSAN: The pro-abortion rights group is hitting New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte for not considering Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, with a five-figure ad going up on cable and digital in New Hampshire. NARAL Pro-Choice America is also endorsing Gov. Maggie Hassan. The ad: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9c916ccbf71d69413fbe4e63964c8416f68dbb267a37899018b183d2960cbe5e

SENATORS WRITE OBAMA ON ISRAEL: A group of 83 senators, led by Sens. Chris Coons and Lindsey Graham, wrote to President Obama on Monday to tell him of their plans to boost funding for missile defense programs for Israel and ask the president to reach a new memorandum of understanding with Israel to increase aid. You can read the whole letter here: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9c916ccbf71d694124f1f590ef73ab4a2ecc099dc283ecee48b0fb708520e6ef

MONDAY'S TRIVIA WINNER - Patrick Boland was the first to answer that Pennsylvania's Fifth District is the state's largest congressional district. 

TODAY'S TRIVIA - Patrick has today's question: Who is the last former senator who also served as secretary of state to win the presidency, and what state did they hail from? The first person to correctly answer gets a mention in the next day's Huddle. Email me at beverett@politico.com
