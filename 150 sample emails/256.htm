		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://www.torproject.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://www.torproject.org/'" tppabs="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://tails.boum.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://tails.boum.org/'" tppabs="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://tails.boum.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://tails.boum.org/'" tppabs="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://www.couragefound.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://www.couragefound.org/'" tppabs="https://www.couragefound.org/">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<div class="onion-url">wlupld3ptjvsgwqw.onion</div>
			<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

Jack Kemp’s ghost haunts Paul Ryan as he agonizes over Donald Trump &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvcG93ZXJwb3N0L3BhbG9tYS9kYWlseS0yMDIvMjAxNi8wNS8xMi9kYWlseS0yMDItamFjay1rZW1wLXMtZ2hvc3QtaGF1bnRzLXBhdWwtcnlhbi1hcy1oZS1hZ29uaXplcy1vdmVyLWRvbmFsZC10cnVtcC81NzMzNDA4Nzk4MWI5MmEyMmQ3NDQ2MTUvP3dwbW09MSZ3cGlzcmM9bmxfZGFpbHkyMDI/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C26c00e3f&gt;

THE BIG IDEA:

Paul Ryan considers the late Jack Kemp one of his greatest mentors. The Speaker of the House described himself last month as "a Jack Kemp-Ronald Reagan Republican."

"Donald Trump is a Donald Trump Republican," he added.

When he announced last week that he’s not ready to support the presumptive Republican nominee, he said he wants Trump to change first. “This is the party of Lincoln, of Reagan, of Jack Kemp,” Ryan said on CNN. “What a lot of Republicans want to see is that we have a standard bearer that bears our standards.”

As Ryan meets with Trump this morning, to try making nice, the legacy of the 1996 vice presidential nominee will hang heavily over him.

Kemp, a Buffalo Bills star, who served nine terms as a congressman from New York and then became HUD Secretary under George H.W. Bush after a failed 1988 bid for the Republican presidential nomination, passed away in 2009. In January, the Kemp Foundation hosted a forum on poverty in South Carolina. Ryan moderated. Most of the leading GOP candidates showed up – except for Trump.

-- There is widespread agreement that almost everything about Trumpism would repulse Kemp.

“If he chooses not to represent the conservative ideals and principles that the Republicans have represented, then it’s not incumbent upon others to bow down and kiss the ring and do whatever Mr. Trump wants,” said Jimmy Kemp, who is president of The Jack Kemp Foundation. “My dad’s not here; I don’t know what he would think,” the younger Kemp added during an appearance on Fox News  &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1YU1M5WEEyMjRPRSZ3cG1tPTEmd3Bpc3JjPW5sX2RhaWx5MjAy/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1I718186f4&gt;earlier this week.

“Trump has grabbed this Kempian tradition by the collar and frog-marched it from the room with all the delicacy of one of his security guards ejecting a troublesome protester from a rally,” National Review executive editor Rich Lowry wrote &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYXRpb25hbHJldmlldy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS80MzI5MzMvZG9uYWxkLXRydW1wLWphY2sta2VtcC1nb3A_d3BtbT0xJndwaXNyYz1ubF9kYWlseTIwMg/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C6adec8c4&gt; in March. “Kemp eschewed personal attacks and opposed negative campaigning. He believed ‘the purpose of politics is not to defeat your opponent as much as it is to provide superior leadership and better ideas.’ And the central idea was, always and everywhere, tax cuts. Kemp wanted the GOP to be a ‘natural home of African-Americans.’ He favored openhandedness on immigration. He cared deeply about the plight of the urban poor, and about what he called — long before Jeb Bush — ‘the right to rise.’”

Morton Kondracke and Fred Barnes, who co-wrote a biography about Kemp last year, have agreed that Kemp would disagree with Trump on substance, including issues like eminent domain, and style. “He was the antithesis of Donald Trump in practically every way except high energy,” Kondracke told Newsmax TV last year. Kemp would disagree with Trump on “many, many things,” Barnes added. (The Daily Caller’s Matt Lewis, who  &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cDovL2RhaWx5Y2FsbGVyLmNvbS8yMDE1LzEwLzEyL3BhdWwtcnlhbi1hbmQtamFjay1rZW1wLXZzLWRvbmFsZC10cnVtcC10aGUtZ29wLWF0LWEtY3Jvc3Nyb2Fkcy8_d3BtbT0xJndwaXNyYz1ubF9kYWlseTIwMiNpeHp6NDhSVVZycjU1/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C2ff610e2&gt;flagged the interview, agrees.)

Jeffrey Frank recalls covering Kemp for a Buffalo newspaper in the early 1980s. “Kemp was a cheerful, generous man, but what most deserves recognition, in what’s left of the Republican Party, is less his fascination with such byways as the ‘Laffer Curve’ … and more his persistent voice on behalf of lifting up the needy, the jobless, the disenfranchised—take your pick among the shorthand expressions used to describe America’s poor,” Frank writes for The New Yorker &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZXd5b3JrZXIuY29tL25ld3MvZGFpbHktY29tbWVudC90aGUtZ2hvc3Qtb2YtamFjay1rZW1wP3dwbW09MSZ3cGlzcmM9bmxfZGFpbHkyMDI/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C75266cab&gt;. “His commitment to bettering the lives of African-Americans was passionate and genuine.” The distance between Kemp and Trump, Frank explains, “is a distance to be measured not only in degrees of ideology … but in the appeal … to the nation’s better angels. In this long season, that seems as distant as Jack Kemp’s stubborn inclination to do the decent thing.”

Conservative Post columnist Michael Gerson, who worked for Kemp early in his career before becoming George W. Bush’s speechwriter, recalls his courage. “In 1994, California Gov. Pete Wilson (along with many other Republicans) supported Proposition 187, which denied public services to illegal immigrants, including schooling for their children. In one of his finest hours, Kemp came out strongly against the measure, which he said would imply ‘an ugly antipathy toward all immigrants,’” Gerson wrote in a column last fall &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL29waW5pb25zL3doYXQtd291bGQtamFjay1rZW1wLWRvLzIwMTUvMTAvMDgvNGNkMjIzYWEtNmRkYy0xMWU1LWIzMWMtZDgwZDYyYjUzZTI4X3N0b3J5Lmh0bWw_d3BtbT0xJndwaXNyYz1ubF9kYWlseTIwMg/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C30cb617d&gt;. “This stand probably hurt Kemp’s own presidential prospects.”

The New York Times’ conservative columnist, Ross Douthat, admits to underestimating how unprincipled elected Republican leadership would become &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzA1LzEyL29waW5pb24vY2FtcGFpZ24tc3RvcHMvdGhlLXBhcnR5LXN1cnJlbmRlcnMuaHRtbD9fcj0wJndwbW09MSZ3cGlzcmM9bmxfZGFpbHkyMDI/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C0251bb65&gt; once Trump secured the nomination. To acquiesce to Trump as the nominee is to gamble recklessly with the party’s responsibilities to the republic, he argues today: “It is possible that a dishonorable, cowardly, unprincipled course will yield the result that many in both G.O.P. factions clearly crave: Trump defeated in the general election, his ideas left without a champion, and then a reversion to the party’s status quo ante, to the comforts of a tactically narrow ‘wacko birds versus RINOs’ family feud. But then again it’s possible that the establishment and the Tea Party are more like Byzantium and Sassanid Persia in the seventh century A.D., and Trumpism is the Arab-Muslim invasion that put an end to their long-running rivalry, destroyed the Sassanid Dynasty outright, and ushered in a very different age. No doubt many thought at first that those invaders were a temporary problem, an alien force that would wreak havoc and then withdraw, dissolve, retreat. But a new religion had arrived to stay.”

-- Big picture: Ryan has the House. Trump has the party. Dave Fahrenthold recalls that, five years ago, when the House passed Ryan’s budget, Trump said in an interview: “What he did is political suicide for the Republican Party.”

“Trump rejects Ryan’s entire style of politics, which uses detailed budget projections to sketch out worries for the future, followed by an appeal for shared sacrifice,” Fahrenthold writes in a great story on today’s front page &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL2hhcy1kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXAtc3RvbGVuLXBhdWwtcnlhbnMtcGFydHktb3V0LWZyb20tdW5kZXItaGltLzIwMTYvMDUvMTEvMTJmZDRjNTQtMTcxOS0xMWU2LTkyNGQtODM4NzUzMjk1ZjlhX3N0b3J5Lmh0bWw_d3BtbT0xJndwaXNyYz1ubF9kYWlseTIwMg/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C6406bc78&gt;.

-- The Speaker faces “immediate and mounting pressure” from House Republicans to get behind Trump, per Mike DeBonis &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvcG93ZXJwb3N0L3dwLzIwMTYvMDUvMTEvcGF1bC1yeWFuLWZhY2VzLWludGVuc2UtcHJlc3N1cmUtdG8tcmVjb25jaWxlLXdpdGgtZG9uYWxkLXRydW1wLz93cG1tPTEmd3Bpc3JjPW5sX2RhaWx5MjAy/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C85729891&gt;. “Ryan continues to enjoy widespread goodwill among his colleagues after stepping up to end the leadership crisis prompted by Boehner’s resignation … But many of those colleagues have thus far been unwilling to take Ryan’s cues on major legislative matters. The House is set to blow past Sunday’s statutory deadline for passing a budget, and a bill Ryan supports to address Puerto Rico’s fiscal crisis remains mired in committee … A prolonged rift with Trump could further undermine Ryan’s ability to lead his caucus.”

-- Both sides plan to be cordial and sound accommodating after today’s meetings. “I fully expect that Paul Ryan will support Donald Trump publicly,” former Vice President Dan Quayle said on NBC’s “Today” show.

-- But no matter what niceties are uttered, Dan Balz argues that Trump and GOP leaders may never get on the same page &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL3RydW1wLWFuZC1nb3AtbGVhZGVycy1taWdodC1uZXZlci1iZS1vbi10aGUtc2FtZS1wYWdlLzIwMTYvMDUvMTEvMzFiN2I4M2MtMTc4Ny0xMWU2LTkyNGQtODM4NzUzMjk1ZjlhX3N0b3J5Lmh0bWw_d3BtbT0xJndwaXNyYz1ubF9kYWlseTIwMg/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C1e611cab&gt;: “Whatever reassurances he might try to offer in the face-to-face meetings — and Trump knows how to be charming in his personal encounters — could easily be washed away by his determination to keep running the way he has run throughout the primaries, as a political provocateur of no fixed ideology.” Dan describes today “is barely the beginning of a long period of uncertainty and taking stock.”

-- GOP leaders are taking a wait-and-see approach to decide whether to cut Trump loose. They wonder if voters rally around him or if the bottom falls out once the Clinton machine opens fire. Balz recalls 1996: “In the final days of that campaign, as GOP nominee Bob Dole was heading toward a loss against then-President Bill Clinton, the party ran television ads calling on voters not to turn over both the executive and legislative branches to the Democrats.”

-- “At this point, assessing the Trump Effect is speculative because — even assuming, prematurely, a Trump trouncing — not all landslide losses are created equal when it comes to their broader impact,” E.J. Dionne notes in his column &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL29waW5pb25zL3RoZS1nb3BzLW1hZGRlbmluZy10cnVtcC1jb251bmRydW0vMjAxNi8wNS8xMS9jZTlmOGFmOC0xN2E1LTExZTYtOWUxNi0yZTVhMTIzYWFjNjJfc3RvcnkuaHRtbD93cG1tPTEmd3Bpc3JjPW5sX2RhaWx5MjAy/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1Cc4f436b9&gt;. “Lyndon Johnson’s win over Goldwater, along with the victories of Ronald Reagan in 1980 and Barack Obama in 2008, had clear down-ticket effects. But the substantial triumphs of Dwight Eisenhower in 1956, Richard Nixon in 1972 and Bill Clinton in 1996 did not call forth comparable congressional earthquakes.”

-- No matter what he tells Ryan, Trump cannot change. Even if he tried. Even if he wanted to. The New York Times fronts a story &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzA1LzEyL3VzL3BvbGl0aWNzL2RvbmFsZC10cnVtcC1jYW1wYWlnbi5odG1sP3dwbW09MSZ3cGlzcmM9bmxfZGFpbHkyMDI/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C1bcb8045&gt; today about a phone interview in which the billionaire businessman says he will not change his approach to running for president because he has a “mandate” to be provocative. “You win the pennant and now you're in the World Series - you gonna change? People like the way I'm doing,” he said. “'In a Broadway theater, the best, the best, absolute best sale is called "word of mouth. … If people love a Broadway show, it's better than if you write a good review. Word of mouth is the No. 1 thing. And the word of mouth at my rallies is like, ‘You've got to go see it.’ And, you know, one person goes and they talk about it to 20 people."

Ryan's staff is sick of the attention paid to this meeting--because there is no upside for him:

-- George Zimmerman is auctioning off the gun he used to kill Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old unarmed black teenager, in 2012. “I am honored and humbled to announce the sale of an American Firearm Icon,” Zimmerman wrote in the description of the gun used to kill Martin. “The firearm for sale is the firearm that was used to defend my life and end the brutal attack from Trayvon Martin on 2/26/2012.”  Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in the case but acquitted by a Florida jury in 2013. The case sparked a nationwide debate and protests over “stand your ground” laws and race relations in the United States. (Travis M.

FBI DIRECTOR FEELS "PRESSURE" ON HILLARY EMAIL INVESTIGATION: James B. Comey said yesterday he is not letting political events dictate a deadline for completing the bureau’s investigation into the possible mishandling of classified information involving Clinton. “I don’t tether to any particular external deadline,” Comey told reporters during a roundtable. He added there was “pressure” to do the investigation promptly and well. “In any investigation, especially one of intense public interest . . . we want to do it well, and we want to do it promptly,” he said. “So I feel pressure to do both of those things. . . . But as between the two, we will always choose well.”

Comey pushed back on Hillary’s suggestion, which she repeats whenever asked about the scandal, that the FBI is merely doing a security review, or "inquiry." He said he is unfamiliar with such terminology. (Ostensibly Brooklyn came up with such phraseology after focus grouping what sounds the least bad to average voters.) “We’re conducting an investigation,” Comey said. “That’s the bureau’s business. That’s what we do. . . . It’s in our name.”

Where things stand: “Investigators have found scant evidence tying Clinton to criminal wrongdoing, although they are still working on the case and charges have not been ruled out, officials have said,” per Justice Department beat reporter Ellen Nakashima &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL3dvcmxkL25hdGlvbmFsLXNlY3VyaXR5L2ZiaS1kaXJlY3Rvci10aGVyZS1pcy1uby1leHRlcm5hbC1kZWFkbGluZS1mb3ItaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi1pbnZvbHZpbmctY2xpbnRvbi1lbWFpbHMvMjAxNi8wNS8xMS9kYTUxNDc2Ni0xN2E0LTExZTYtOTI0ZC04Mzg3NTMyOTVmOWFfc3RvcnkuaHRtbD93cG1tPTEmd3Bpc3JjPW5sX2RhaWx5MjAy/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C2776a93b&gt;. “Prosecutors and FBI agents hope to be able to interview Clinton as they try to wrap up the investigation.

TRUMP (STILL) NOT READY FOR PRIMETIME:

Trump in Eugene, Ore. (Reuters/Jim Urquhart)

-- Trump is all over the place on tax returns because he does not understand that pretending he wants to release them will only ratchet up pressure on him to actually release them. After telling the AP he would not put them out until after the IRS has completed auditing him, last night he told Greta Van Susteren on Fox News that he will release them. "I'll release,” he said. “Hopefully before the election I'll release ... And I'd like to release.” In a tweet, he wrote: “In interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete, not after election!”

Mitt Romney, of all people, said Trump’s refusal to release his returns is “DISQUALIFYING”: “It is disqualifying for a modern-day presidential nominee to refuse to release tax returns to the voters, especially one who has not been subject to public scrutiny in either military or public service,” he wrote in a scathing Facebook statement &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmFjZWJvb2suY29tL21pdHRyb21uZXkvcG9zdHMvMTAxNTM0ODcwMTY4NjExMjE_d3BtbT0xJndwaXNyYz1ubF9kYWlseTIwMg/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C73601082&gt;. “Mr. Trump says he is being audited. So? There is nothing that prevents releasing tax returns that are being audited.” Romney again accused Trump of concealing a “bombshell” by withholding release.

The Post’s Fact Checker gives Trump Four Pinocchios for his claim that there is “nothing to learn” &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvcG93ZXJwb3N0L3BhbG9tYS9kYWlseS0yMDIvMjAxNi8wNC8yMS9kYWlseS0yMDItaGlsbGFyeS1jbGludG9uLXdpbGwtY29uc2lkZXItcGlja2luZy1hbm90aGVyLXdvbWFuLWZvci12cC1jb3VsZC1pdC1iZS1lbGl6YWJldGgtd2FycmVuLzU3MTc5MWNiOTgxYjkyYTIyZDBjNzFkOS8_d3BtbT0xJndwaXNyYz1ubF9kYWlseTIwMg/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1Cf911c29c&gt;  from his tax returns: “To the contrary, voters would learn a lot of information that Trump has long tried to hide from the public,” Glenn Kessler writes. “Tax returns would help lift a veil of secrecy about Trump’s finances — and let voters know whether his claims about his wealth and charitable giving are true, or if he’s just a bombastic man behind the curtain akin to the Wizard of Oz.” 

-- Trump said his Muslim ban was just a “suggestion”: In a radio interview with Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade, Trump tried to softened his stance on temporarily banning Muslims from traveling to the U.S. “It’s a temporary ban. It hasn’t been called for yet, nobody’s done it. This is just a suggestion until we find out what’s going on,” Trump said.

-- He said he does not regret saying that John McCain is "not a war hero" because he got captured. "You know, I don’t like to regret anything,” he said in another radio interview. “After I said that, my poll numbers went up seven points.” (Buzzfeed &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnV6emZlZWQuY29tL2FuZHJld2thY3p5bnNraS90cnVtcC1pLWRvbnQtcmVncmV0LW1jY2Fpbi1jb21tZW50cy1teS1wb2xscy1udW1iZXJzLXdlbnQtdXA_dXRtX3Rlcm09Lm9tbEdtYjlkWiZ3cG1tPTEmd3Bpc3JjPW5sX2RhaWx5MjAyIy5ybU1sT3BKZHc/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1Cadbff24e&gt;)

-- Newt Gingrich officially endorsed Trump last night, telling Fox’s Sean Hannity he plans to work “very hard for the nominee. He also did not rule out the possibility of being Trump’s running-mate, saying he “would certainly talk about it.” “I wouldn’t rule it out automatically,” he said.

-- The white supremacist who Trump put on his delegate slate in California resigned. William Johnson, a corporate lawyer who has called for a “whites-only United States” and deportation of other races and ethnicities, said he wants to help the campaign by bowing out. “Nobody knows who I am … you can’t hold that against the vetting people in a campaign. I didn’t emblazon on there that I’m a white nationalist.” It is hard to believe the campaign was unaware of his beliefs: Johnson founded a pro-Trump super PAC and was the voice behind racist robocalls warning of “white genocide” that received extensive media coverage earlier this year. (Kevin Sullivan and Elahe Izadi &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL3RydW1wLW5vbWluYXRlcy10aGVuLWR1bXBzLXdoaXRlLXN1cHJlbWFjaXN0LWFzLWEtZ29wLWNvbnZlbnRpb24tZGVsZWdhdGUvMjAxNi8wNS8xMS8yMDI4MTQ4MC0xN2ExLTExZTYtOTI0ZC04Mzg3NTMyOTVmOWFfc3RvcnkuaHRtbD93cG1tPTEmd3Bpc3JjPW5sX2RhaWx5MjAy/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1Ce6214e6c&gt;)

Trump's willingness to participate in the functions — after months of bashing other candidates for their ties to wealthy contributors — represents a dramatic shift in his posture.”

Trump remains anathema to most elites: “While he has secured the backing of some prominent donors and fundraisers, including New York investor Anthony Scaramucci, many top GOP bundlers have been privately discussing their reservations about helping the real estate magnate raise funds. The angst is so acute that some have offered to quietly send over a list of the donors they know, but do not even want to be assigned a bundler number to get credit for the checks they bring in.”

Michael Ceraso told Politico &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xpdGljby5jb20vc3RvcnkvMjAxNi8wNS9iZXJuaWUtc2FuZGVycy1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLW1pY2hhZWwtY2VyYXNvLTIyMzA3Nz93cG1tPTEmd3Bpc3JjPW5sX2RhaWx5MjAy/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1Cc6e88dc6&gt; that he advocated for a strategy that involved more investment on field and digital organizing than on television advertising.

-- A group of Sanders staffers and volunteers is circulating a proposal calling on him to leave the race after California to concentrate on building a national progressive organization to stop Trump. “The group of over a dozen Sanders backers crafting the proposal — a collection of volunteers and current and former Sanders staff members, all veterans of other high-profile campaigns, including Obama’s … believes that leaving an imprint on the party platform is an overrated goal," Politico’s Gabriel Debenedetti &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xpdGljby5jb20vc3RvcnkvMjAxNi8wNS9zYW5kZXJzLWJhY2tlcnMtcGxvdC1wb3N0LXByaW1hcnktd2FyLW9uLXRydW1wLTIyMzEwMD93cG1tPTEmd3Bpc3JjPW5sX2RhaWx5MjAy/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C866befd0&gt; reports. "They suggest that the Vermont senator should exit the race if it’s clear he cannot win — a call similar to the one made by Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, his lone Senate endorser — rather than spend the five weeks before the convention in limbo."

-- The hyper-local strategy continues: Clinton delivered a call for D.C. statehood, vowing to “champion” legislation and blasting Trump for failing to take a position on the issue. “In the case of our nation’s capital, we have an entire populace that is routinely denied a voice in its own democracy,” Clinton wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Informer. “Washingtonians serve in the military, serve on juries, and pay taxes just like everyone else. And yet, they don’t even have a vote in Congress.” Her piece comes just four weeks before District residents vote in the city’s Democratic primary. (Aaron C.

But every step of the way, a journalist is left asking herself: Where does reality end and artifice begin? How much is staged and how much is spontaneous? Reporters were permitted to do vox pops (that is, gather quotes from ordinary citizens) on a street corner on Friday morning, stopping people as they apparently made their way to or from the Chunoo subway station. But one reporter spotted the same couple walk by twice, then another swore she saw a woman she’d interviewed that day walk through her hotel lobby that night. It’s enough to make you question whether the sunlight is real or a giant lamp has been installed in the sky."

Americans are fully capable of reviewing the 28 pages and making up their own minds about their significance.”

“As co-chair of the Joint Inquiry Into the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001, I have read the 28 pages,” Graham adds. “My oath of confidentiality forbids me from discussing the specifics of that material. But while I cannot reveal those details, I strongly believe the American people deserve to know why this issue is so important.”

John Kasich remains at 61 percent in Ohio. And Two-thirds of Kansans disapprove of the job Sam Brownback is doing. 

Per the surveys, the most popular governors are:
Charlie Baker (R-Mass.)   Larry Hogan (R-Md.)   Jack Dalrymple (R-N.D.)   Brian Sandoval (R-Nev.)   Bill Walker (I-Alaska)   Steve Bullock (D-Mont.)   Bill Haslam (R-Tenn.)   Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.)   Jack Markell (D-Del.)   Gary Herbert (R-Utah)
And the LEAST popular are:

“Judge Garland Withheld Key Financial Information From Senate,” from Roll Call &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yb2xsY2FsbC5jb20vbmV3cy9qdWRnZS1nYXJsYW5kLXdpdGhoZWxkLWtleS1maW5hbmNpYWwtaW5mb3JtYXRpb24tc2VuYXRlP3dwbW09MSZ3cGlzcmM9bmxfZGFpbHkyMDI/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C5ed2a9ae&gt; : “Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland left out a key piece of financial disclosure information when he filed nomination paperwork to the Senate on Tuesday. The omission protects Garland’s privacy as long as it appears Republicans will persist in not holding confirmation hearings. But it also could be seen as a way to prompt Republicans into unwittingly starting the confirmation process by asking for more information. White House spokesperson Brandi Hoffine said Garland would provide more information — if Grassley asked for it.”

By afternoon, the clouds should finally show a few breaks but direct rays of sun remain a scarce commodity. This should at least allow highs to reach the upper 60s in most areas and even lower 70s are possible.”

-- The MLB suspended Bryce Harper for one game and fined him an “undisclosed amount” for actions following his ejection Monday. Harper is appealing the suspension, which makes him eligible to play until the process is complete. Harper was tossed from the dugout in the ninth inning by a home-plate umpire for arguing a called third strike. After he was tossed, Harper shouted at the umpire and had to be held back by coaches. Later in the inning, Harper ran out of the clubhouse and back onto the field, which isn’t allowed following an ejection. While in the dogpile with teammates, Harper turned and pointed at the umpire yelling, “[Expletive] you!” (James Wagner &lt;http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6706649.464667/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWxzLWpvdXJuYWwvd3AvMjAxNi8wNS8xMS9icnljZS1oYXJwZXItc3VzcGVuZGVkLWZvci1vbmUtZ2FtZS1ieS1tbGIvP2hwaWQ9aHBfbG9jYWwtbmV3c19oYXJwZXItNTI1cG06aG9tZXBhZ2Uvc3Rvcnkmd3BtbT0xJndwaXNyYz1ubF9kYWlseTIwMg/55c8886a6e4adc304b9cf8c1C703763ea&gt;)
