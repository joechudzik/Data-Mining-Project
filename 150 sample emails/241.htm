		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://www.torproject.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://www.torproject.org/'" tppabs="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://tails.boum.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://tails.boum.org/'" tppabs="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://tails.boum.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://tails.boum.org/'" tppabs="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://www.couragefound.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://www.couragefound.org/'" tppabs="https://www.couragefound.org/">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<div class="onion-url">wlupld3ptjvsgwqw.onion</div>
			<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

FINANCIERS: Rep. Scott Garrett's (R-N.J.) anti-gay positions have cost him corporate donors and now his fundraising consultant. William Oorbeek dropped Garrett as a client late last year, sources told POLITICO's Zachary Warmbrodt and Anna Palmer. Garrett is fighting the race of his career against a well-funded Democrat. Garrett has since hired Hammond &amp; Associates, which also works with Freedom Caucus members Jim Jordan and Scott DesJarlais. Read more in the latest Financial Services Influence.

THEY'RE FEELING LUCKY: Google confirmed to POLITICO yesterday it will be taking an official role in this summer's Republican convention, reports Pro Technology's Tony Romm. The tech giant - facing harsh criticism from advocates denouncing GOP front-runner Donald Trump's controversial comments on minorities, immigrants and women - will run the official livestream at the Cleveland event, providing attendees and viewers with election trends, videos, virtual reality tools and other data. Google offered similar services at both parties' conventions in 2012, as well as at presidential debates earlier this year. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2ef0ca45ffc2c893fad104907d61a619e83236142efdfe80f755df4f7c9e294a

GAME ON: Billionaire environmentalist and NextGen Climate founder Tom Steyer has kicked off his $25 million dollar outreach campaign - an effort to get out the vote among young people in swing states - ahead of California's state Republican party convention this weekend, reports POLITICO California's Carla Marinucci. As part of the campaign, TV ads featuring GOP candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz will run for all three days of the convention, starting today. Trump and Cruz, as well as Cruz's newly announced running mate Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich will attend this weekend's events in Burlingame, Calif. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2ef0ca45ffc2c8932333e3dbc337b98e5de7a8fc896b2da03e6b51418368657a

BUILDERS: Construction Dive's Kim Slowey reports construction lobbying is on the rise, citing Center for Responsive Politics data that shows the industry spent more than $53 million lobbying in 2015. Jim Tobin, National Association of Home Builders executive vice president and chief lobbyist, said his group has been "extraordinarily busy" because of the Obama administration's "anti-business" policies. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2ef0ca45ffc2c893597dc4fafe9b5d181faba6bde8338e2fc92c7256dffea5b5

ROI: A new analysis from Maplight shows that for every one dollar U.S. government contractors have invested in political influence in the past decade, the industry has received $1,171 in taxpayer money. Maplight's Frank Bass writes that the 25 largest federal contractors have received almost $1.6 trillion during fiscal 2014 for their work since October 2005. Additionally, the Pentagon spends more on contracting than all other federal agencies combined. Lockeed Martin Corp., the country's largest contractor and maker of the F-35 Lightning II jet, received $331 billion in federal money since October 2005, and spent $140 million on lobbying and political contributions between then and
 September 2015. This puts the firm's return at $2,366 for every $1 dollar used for lobbying or political spending. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2ef0ca45ffc2c8931fc4069fca6511468c2f6b6bb6dd76f43df228f8814dee4c
