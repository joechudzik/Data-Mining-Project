		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://www.torproject.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://www.torproject.org/'" tppabs="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://tails.boum.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://tails.boum.org/'" tppabs="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://tails.boum.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://tails.boum.org/'" tppabs="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://www.couragefound.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://www.couragefound.org/'" tppabs="https://www.couragefound.org/">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<div class="onion-url">wlupld3ptjvsgwqw.onion</div>
			<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

White House developing legislative strategy to pass Pacific trade deal&lt;http://thehill.com/policy/finance/trade/280630-white-house-developing-legislative-strategy-on-trade&gt;

THE HILL // VICKI NEEDHAM

The White House is developing a plan to pass a sweeping Pacific Rim trade deal in Congress this year. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday that Obama administration officials have been in touch with congressional Democrats and Republicans who are supportive of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) to "develop a legislative strategy for moving forward." "We're going to continue to consult about the best path forward and we would like to see Congress act soon to approve the agreement," Earnest told reporters. Earnest said that the White House is pushing for a vote in Congress before the lame-duck session after the November elections. "And the case that we have made is consistent with the argument that the Chamber of Commerce and other influential Republican-leaning organizations have made, which is that every day that goes by is a missed opportunity for American businesses and American workers to benefit from this agreement," he said.

Obama grapples with Vietnam arms ban, human rights on eve of trip&lt;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-obama-idUSKCN0YB00N&gt;

REUTERS // MATT SPEALNICK AND DAVID BRUNNSTROM

President Barack Obama is still grappling with a historic decision on whether to lift the U.S. arms embargo on Vietnam just days before he travels there, the White House said on Thursday, signaling that human rights concerns could be a sticking point. Support has grown within the U.S. administration and on Capitol Hill to fully remove or at least further ease the ban on weapons sales, bolstering ties between former wartime enemies Washington and Hanoi to counter a rising China. But Obama also faces stiff opposition in some quarters. Ending the embargo - something Vietnam has long sought - would sweep away one of the last major vestiges of the Vietnam War era as Obama makes his first trip there beginning on Monday. It would also anger Beijing, which condemned Obama's partial lifting of the ban in 2014 as interference in the region.

Biden: Sanders should be "more aggressive" in condemning backers' attacks&lt;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-sanders-should-be-more-aggressive-in-condemning-backers-attacks/&gt;

CBS NEWS // REENA FLORES

After a chaotic Democratic state convention in Nevada over the weekend, Vice President Joe Biden is pushing Bernie Sanders to do more when it comes to reigning in his supporters' attacks on the party. "What Bernie's going to have to do if that happens again -- he's going to have to be more aggressive in speaking out about it," Biden told reporters Wednesday at an event in Columbus, Ohio. In Nevada Saturday, Sanders supporters took issue with what they believed was an unfair process of selecting delegates that favored Clinton. Security was forced to shut the convention down after Sanders backers reportedly threw chairs and heckled California Sen. Barbara Boxer. Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz came out with a stern warning for Sanders Tuesday, saying the party was "deeply concerned about the troubling details" out of Las Vegas.

Joe Biden Pens Open Letter to 12-Year-Old Version of Himself&lt;https://www.yahoo.com/tv/joe-biden-pens-open-letter-to-12-year-old-version-211413962.html&gt;

YAHOO NEWS // TONY MACCIO

As part of the CBS This Morning segment "Note to Self," Vice President Joe Biden penned an open letter to a younger version of himself, 12-year-old Joey Biden. "Dear Joe, you're only 12," Biden begins. "Your stutter is debilitating. It embarrasses you, and the bullies are vicious." Biden goes on to discuss taking the advice of his parents, who taught him the values that eventually led to his involvement in social justice and politics. "An intolerance for the abuse of power will inspire you to stand up for civil rights," he writes. "And because you listened, you'll live a life fully consistent with what you were taught by mom and dad and your faith." Biden also opens up about the incredible losses he has experienced during his life. In 1972 his wife and young daughter died in a car accident. And in 2015 he lost his son Beau to brain cancer.

Judge quotes movies to rebuke Justice Dept. lawyers in Obama immigration case&lt;http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/obama-immigration-hanen-223390&gt;

POLITICO // SEUNG MIN KIM

A federal judge slapped an extraordinarily unusual order on Justice Department lawyers on Thursday, saying they misled him about details of President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration, ordering up names of certain immigrants here illegally and calling on the administration's attorneys to take a legal ethics course every year. In a sternly-worded order, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen argued that lawyers for the Obama administration were intentionally deceptive when they discussed how many work permits had been issued under Obama's November 2014 immigration directive. The Supreme Court is currently weighing the legality of Obama's actions. "The misconduct in this case was intentional, serious and material," Hanen wrote in the 28-page order filed Thursday. "In fact, it is hard to imagine a more serious, more calculated plan of unethical conduct." At issue is a batch of work permits issued by the Obama administration to certain immigrants without legal status shortly before Hanen handed down his order blocking the implementation of Obama's controversial executive actions. All together, Obama's actions could affect more than 4 million immigrants here without legal status.

Obama Administration Considers Lifting Vietnam Arms Embargo&lt;http://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-administration-considers-lifting-vietnam-arms-embargo-1463702067&gt;

WALL STREET JOURNAL // CAROL LEE AND JAMES HOOKWAY

President Barack Obama is considering removing restrictions on the sale of arms to Vietnam as he prepares to visit there next week, a move that would mark a significant shift in U.S. policy as he tries to strengthen ties between the two nations. Ben Rhodes, a deputy national-security adviser, said administration officials have been discussing with members of Congress the possibility of lifting the arms embargo, a step Vietnam has long lobbied the U.S. to take. The push has drawn new momentum from the standoff between Vietnam and other countries with China over resources and territory in the region. The U.S., while taking no position on the disputes themselves, has backed smaller countries against Beijing in calling for multilateral talks to settle disputes. Mr. Obama will outline "how we intend to approach [the embargo] going forward" when he meets with Vietnamese officials, including President Tran Dai Quang, Mr. Rhodes said.

Democrats expect Warren to play peacemaker once primary ends&lt;http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/280631-democrats-expect-warren-to-play-peacemaker-once-primary-ends&gt;

THE HILL // ALEXANDER BOLTON

Democratic senators expect Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) will soon make moves to mollify restive liberals and unify the Democratic Party behind Hillary Clinton. Several Democratic senators say they have approached Warren about the role she can play, insisting she is best positioned to mend the schism between the Clinton and Bernie Sanders wings of the party. Warren has a loyal following among the more liberal Democrats who favor Sanders. She has told colleagues she will play the role of peacemaker, but not until after the last major round of primaries on June 7. "I think Elizabeth can and will be very helpful," said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), a Clinton backer who spoke to Warren on Wednesday. "She is very interested, at least in my conversations with her, in doing everything she can to help get the party to unite for November," she added.

DNC to offer Sanders more seats on convention platform committee: report&lt;http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/280637-dnc-to-offer-sanders-seats-on-convention-platform&gt;

THE HILL // JESSIE HELLMANN

The Democratic National Committee plans to offer Bernie Sanders seats on a key platform committee this summer at the party's convention, according to a Washington Post report. Sanders has said remaining in the race despite lagging behind rival Hillary Clinton in delegates is a way to shape the party's platform to align with his own progressive politics; his proposals include a $15 national minimum wage and a single-payer healthcare system. Tensions between Sanders and the Democratic Party have grown in recent weeks as he accuses the party of stacking the deck against him in an effort to hand Clinton the nomination. He recently sent a letter to DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz demanding more committee spots at the convention.

DNC to offer Sanders a convention concession&lt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/dnc-to-offer-sanders-a-convention-concession/2016/05/19/99706b54-1df4-11e6-8c7b-6931e66333e7_story.html&gt;

WASHINGTON POST // ABBY PHILLIP AND ANNE GEARAN

In an attempt to head off an ugly conflict at its convention this summer, the Democratic National Committee plans to offer a concession to Sen. Bernie Sanders - seats on a key convention platform committee - but it may not be enough to stop Sanders from picking a fight over the party's policy positions. Allies of both Clinton and Sanders have urged Democratic leaders to meet some of Sanders's more mundane demands for greater inclusion at the Philadelphia convention. Their decision to do so is expected to be finalized by the end of the week, according to two people familiar with the discussions. But growing mistrust between Sanders supporters and party leaders have threatened to undermine that effort. Even with the committee assignments, Sanders plans an aggressive effort to extract platform concessions on key policies that could prompt divisive battles at a moment when front-runner Hillary Clinton will be trying to unify the party. Among other issues, he plans to push for a $15 national

Reid calls McConnell 'classless'&lt;http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/harry-reid-mitch-mcconnell-book-223382&gt;

POLITICO // BURGESS EVERETT

Harry Reid said Thursday that Mitch McConnell's description of him as "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" in a leaked book excerpt was a "classless" move that he would never have done to his fellow Senate leader. In a brief interview, Senate Minority Leader Reid (D-Nev.) jabbed McConnell for not giving him any heads-up that his book would contain such a diss of Reid. In the excerpt, McConnell writes that Reid is "rhetorically challenged," acts differently in private than in public and that his "lack of restraint goes against what is expected from a party leader." "Boy, that book must not be selling very well if he needs that to pep it up," Reid said on Thursday. "I just think it's fairly classless."

Bipartisan Puerto Rico crisis bill introduced, debt looms&lt;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-idUSKCN0YA1TU&gt;

REUTERS // DANIEL BASES AND SUSAN HEAVEY

U.S. lawmakers on Thursday began coalescing around revised bipartisan legislation to help address Puerto Rico's unpayable debt burden, which now threatens a full-blown humanitarian crisis. Released close to midnight on Wednesday, the House Natural Resources Committee's revised bill includes a strong oversight board to direct how and when the island pays its bills and leaves many earlier proposals in place. Puerto Rico has already defaulted on some of its roughly $70 billion in debt while trying to cope with a 45 percent poverty rate among its 3.5 million U.S. citizens. In addition, it is reeling from a Zika virus outbreak that is hurting its critical tourism industry. Language allowing Puerto Rico to cut repayments to creditors without their consent, known as a "cram-down," remains. The bill does not prioritize pensioners over bondholders, but the language remains muddied, one analyst surmised.

De Blasio, Seeking High Ground, Skips Hearing on Control of New York's Schools&lt;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/nyregion/de-blasio-seeking-high-ground-skips-hearing-on-control-of-new-yorks-schools.html?ref=politics&gt;

NEW YORK TIMES // KATE TAYLOR

He had been very respectful, he said. He had testified for nearly four hours and had answered many questions. The facts were clear. Yet his opponents still wanted to play political games. Well, he said, he would no longer play along. Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat seeking to extend mayoral control of New York City's schools in the face of a Republican-controlled State Senate that appears intent on thwarting him, reached on Thursday for one of his default political strategies: When outgunned, claim the moral high ground. "I wish this was about the substance," Mr. de Blasio said in an interview on WNYC of the Senate's reluctance to act on mayoral control. "I wish it was about our children and parents. I'm having trouble seeing how it is." Mr. de Blasio made his comments to justify his decision to skip a Senate hearing on the matter on Thursday. He and the schools chancellor, Carmen Fariña, traveled to Albany two weeks ago to testify at an initial hearing for several hours. The session on Thursday was in Manhattan, opposite City Hall. Nonetheless, Mr. de Blasio said on Wednesday that he would not testify. Ms. Fariña attended and testified.

California Senate passes gun control package&lt;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-politics-gun-control-idUSKCN0YA2ZV&gt;

REUTERS // SHARON BERNSTEIN

The California Senate on Thursday passed a sweeping package of gun control bills that would require background checks for ammunition purchasers, ban possession of high-capacity magazines and establish a firearms violence research center. The bills, whose passage through the Assembly are far from assured, are at the heart of a political duel between Senate leader Kevin de Leon and Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, both Democrats, who are proposing competing plans in advance of key election campaigns. "Gun violence has reached epidemic proportions across our nation," de Leon, who represents Los Angeles, said as he introduced the bills on the Senate floor on Thursday. "We cannot stand by while our communities suffer from this horrific violence."

G.O.P. Donors Shift Focus From Top of Ticket to Senate Races&lt;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/21/us/politics/republican-donors-trump-senate-house.html?_r=0&gt;

NEW YORK TIMES // NICK CORASANITI and ASHLEY PARKER

Hundreds of millions of dollars that Republican groups had been poised to spend in the 2016 presidential election are now increasingly likely to move into Senate and House races, as many big donors look to distance themselves from the party's presumptive nominee, Donald J. Trump. These groups and their Democratic counterparts have already spent more than $25 million on advertising in Senate general election races alone, according to Kantar Media/CMAG, significantly outpacing both the 2014 and 2012 campaigns in outside spending. And more than $134 million in advertising for Senate races alone has been reserved by groups for the general election.

Tom Cotton Thinks America Isn't Locking Enough People Up&lt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-cotton-criminal-justice_us_573e3305e4b00e09e89e8cad?4zy2dhg5569vhd7vi&gt;

HUFFINGTON POST // MOLLIE REILLY

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) is criticizing efforts to reform America's criminal justice system, arguing on Thursday that the country actually has an "under-incarceration problem" - even though the U.S. has the world's largest prison population. Cotton gave a speech on criminal justice Thursday at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C. During his remarks, he argued that policy goals like reducing mandatory minimum sentences, restoring voting rights for felons and reducing barriers to employment for ex-offenders are misguided and "dangerous." "The claim that too many criminals are being jailed, that there is over-incarceration, ignores an unfortunate fact: For the vast majority of crimes, a perpetrator is never identified or arrested, let alone prosecuted, convicted and jailed," Cotton said. "Law enforcement is able to arrest or identify a likely perpetrator for only 19 percent of property crimes and 47 percent of violent crimes. If anything, we have an under-incarceration problem."

House Passes $81 Billion Measure for Veterans and Military Construction&lt;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/us/politics/house-passes-81-billion-measure-for-veterans-and-military-construction.html?ref=politics&gt;

NEW YORK TIMES // DAVID HERSZENHORN AND EMMARIE HUETTEMAN

The House on Thursday approved an $81.6 billion spending measure for veterans affairs and military construction programs after hours of contentious floor debate that at times focused on cultural disputes, including efforts to restrict the flying of the Confederate flag and a bitter split over workplace protections for gays and lesbians employed by federal contractors. Those disputes showed once again that the societal fissures that divide Republicans and Democrats are never far below the surface of any debate in Congress, even over a relatively routine spending measure. The debate over workplace protections had spilled over from Wednesday night when Republicans inserted an amendment to the annual military policy bill that would overturn an executive order by President Obama banning federal government contractors from discriminating against employees based on sexual orientation.

7 Republicans Flipped Their Vote on LGBT Amendment, Setting Them Up for Attack&lt;http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/democrats-pounce-vulnerable-republicans-suspected-switching-vote-lgbt-protections&gt;

ROLL CALL // SIMONE PATHE

After seven Republicans switched their votes from "yes" to "no" Thursday on a measure that have would have protected LGBT workers from discrimination from federal contractors, Democrats quickly turned the votes into an election issue. "House Republicans are so committed to discriminating against LGBT Americans, that they broke regular order to force their members to reverse their votes and support Republicans' bigotry," Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. [Moral Victory on Confederate Flag, Painful Defeat on LGBT Protection] The identities of the seven vote-switchers were not publicly recorded on the House floor. The amendment failed 212-213. Democrats in the House were in an uproar, shouting "Shame, Shame, Shame," and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer protested because the presiding officer did not require that the members record the changes.

House turns into battleground over LGBT rights&lt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/05/19/house-turns-into-battleground-over-lgbt-rights/&gt;

WASHINGTON POST // KAROUN DEMIRJIAN

The House floor is turning into an emotional, and at times ugly, battleground over LGBT rights, as Democrats accuse Republicans of promoting bigotry and discrimination over proposals GOP leaders say are intended to protect freedom of religion from government overreach. The conflict erupted on Thursday when Republican leaders successfully whipped their members to vote down a Democratic amendment that sought to prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to pay contractors that discriminate against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The proposal authored by Rep. Sean Maloney (D-N.Y.), an openly gay member of Congress, appeared on the cusp of being adopted as the vote came to a close, but at the last minute six Republican members switched their votes and the amendment was defeated on a 212-to-213 vote.

House Lawmakers Feud Over Failed Antidiscrimination Measure&lt;http://www.wsj.com/articles/house-lawmakers-brawl-over-failed-antidiscrimination-measure-1463681618&gt;

WALL STREET JOURNAL // KRISTINA PETERSON

An angry fight erupted on the House floor Thursday when an antidiscrimination measure failed by a single vote after some Republican lawmakers changed their positions. Democrats chanted "shame" when last-minute GOP opposition sank an amendment from Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D., N.Y.) that appeared moments earlier to have the votes to pass. The amendment to the military construction spending bill would have prevented taxpayer funds from going to government contractors who refused to comply with an executive order barring them from hiring or firing employees based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The measure was blocked in a 212-213 vote, with all 213 no votes coming from Republicans. Yes votes came from 183 Democrats and 29 Republicans.

Shouts of "Shame, shame, shame," erupted in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday as Republican lawmakers narrowly defeated legislation to protect the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees of government contractors. The measure, an amendment to a veterans and military construction spending bill introduced by New York Democrat Sean Maloney, initially had enough "yes" votes to pass, according to the count in the House chamber. But House Republican leaders extended the time allowed for the vote as they urged enough party members to change their positions to defeat it by a vote of 213 to 212. All 183 Democrats who voted backed the amendment, joined by 29 Republicans. All 213 "no" votes were from Republicans. Eight House members - three Republicans and five Democrats - did not vote. Lawmakers are allowed to change their vote in the few minutes between voting and the result being declared. LGBT rights have been a hot-button issue during the 2016 election season.

THE HILL // PAULINA FIROZI

Republican senators are touting their accomplishments in a new Wes Anderson-style video called "Senate Squad." In the clip, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell struts around the U.S. Capitol, greeting his "squad" as the video lists the senators and thier specific legislative accomplishments. It features Sens. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), Lamar Alexander (R-Ten.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), John Thune (R-S.D.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). Some of the accomplishments include expediting natural gas exports, sanctions on North Korea, modernizing energy policy and combating heroin and prescriptions drugs.

Oklahoma's Legislature Passed A Bill Making It A Felony To Perform An Abortion&lt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oklahoma-abortion_us_573df1b9e4b0aee7b8e94b41&gt;

HUFFINGTON POST // SAMANTHA LACHMAN

Oklahoma's legislature passed a first-in-the-nation law Thursday that would make it a felony for abortion providers to perform or induce the procedure. Senate Bill 1552 now heads to the desk of Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin (R). It contains no exceptions for cases of rape and incest or to protect the health of a pregnant person. (Abortions necessary to save the mother's life are acceptable under the law.) Doctors would be barred from obtaining a license to practice medicine in the state if they violated the law, which refers to performing an abortion as "unprofessional conduct." The minimum punishment for the law would be one year in jail. The Center for Reproductive Rights said in April that it was "closely watching" the legislation. There's no doubt that the bill would be challenged if Fallin gives her approval. Her office told a local news outlet that it wouldn't comment until her staff had reviewed the legislation.

Oklahoma Law Banning Abortion Unlikely to Reach Supreme Court &lt;http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/oklahoma-abortion-ban-overturn-roe-v-wade&gt;

ROLL CALL // ERIC GARCIA

A bill passed on Thursday by the Oklahoma legislature that would make performing abortions a felony punishable by jail time would not likely lead to the overturning of Roe v. Wade, legal experts say. The bill is now with Gov. Mary Fallin, who hasn't expressed an opinion on it and has five days to act. Proponents said it was passed with the intent of restricting abortion rights through the courts, and its sponsor hopes it will eventually be a means of overturning the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal. But experts think that's unlikely. "Clearly on the trial and court of appeals levels, the law would unlikely to be upheld," said Jonathan Turley, a professor of constitutional law at George Washington University.

In a reversal, Md. Gov. Larry Hogan signs bill limiting civil asset forfeiture&lt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-a-reversal-md-gov-larry-hogan-signs-bill-limiting-civil-asset-forfeiture/2016/05/19/c2b960e4-1df2-11e6-9c81-4be1c14fb8c8_story.html&gt;

WASHINGTON POST // ASHLEY BALCERZAK

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan on Thursday became the latest state leader to sign contentious legislation restricting civil asset forfeiture - the process that allows police to seize and keep property suspected of being connected to illegal activity without having to convict, or even charge, the owner with a crime. Hogan's signature represents a stark reversal for the Republican governor, who, under pressure from high-profile law enforcement groups, vetoed a bill on the same subject last year. The General Assembly promptly overrode the veto to pass that measure and then introduced additional changes this year that limit state involvement in a federal forfeiture program and require authorities to report what they seize. Widespread civil forfeiture has been controversial since becoming a key tool in the drug war in the 1980s. The back-and-forth in Maryland is part of a fresh round of battles being waged in statehouses nationwide because Congress has stalled on passing federal reforms - though a new federal measure was introduced Thursday.

WASHINGTON POST // CATHERINE HO

Rep. Renee Ellmers (R-N.C.), who is facing a tough primary challenge in June, declared her support Thursday for North Carolina's controversial "bathroom bill," which requires people to use public restrooms that correspond with their birth gender, not the gender with which they identify. In a debate against her primary challengers Rep. George Holding (R-N.C.) and Raleigh physician Greg Brannon, Ellmers said she does not believe the new law, also known as House Bill 2 or HB2, is discriminatory. However, she acknowledged that since charges of discrimination have been brought, the law should be examined closely. "I do believe in the essence of HB2," Ellmers said. "I do believe the federal government needs to back off. This is a state issue and needs to be handled by the general assembly and the governor."

CBS/NYT national poll: Hillary Clinton's lead over Donald Trump narrows&lt;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbsnyt-national-poll-hillary-clintons-lead-over-donald-trump-narrows/&gt;

CBS NEWS // ANTHONY SALVANTO, FRED BACKUS, SARAH DUTTON AND JENNIFER DE PINTO

Looking ahead to the general election in November, Donald Trump trails both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders among registered voters, although by slightly narrower margins than last month. Hillary Clinton now holds a six-point lead over Donald Trump, down from 10 points a month ago. Trump trails Bernie Sanders by 13 points, down from 17 points. Contentious primary contests on both sides haven't turned off many primary voters from voting for their party's candidate in a likely November match-up between Trump and Clinton, even if these candidates are not their preferred primary choice. Seventy-one percent of Republican voters who did not support Trump in the primaries would still vote for him against Clinton. On the Democratic side, 72 percent of Sanders supporters would vote for Clinton against Donald Trump.

Writer and activist Shaun King has a prolific presence on social media and an outspoken passion for Bernie Sanders. King appeared in Sanders's Spike Lee-directed promotional video that came out shortly before the New York primary, and he has consistently advocated for the senator from Vermont on Twitter for months. On Thursday, he used Twitter to vent about something that frustrated him: Hillary Clinton's assertion that she leads the Democratic primary by 3 million votes, a figure that he says is inaccurate and overstated. It isn't.

Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Set for Clash on Gun Control&lt;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-gun-control.html?ref=politics&amp;_r=0&gt;

NEW YORK TIMES // TRIP GABRIEL

If more people were armed, Donald J. Trump says at rallies, mass shootings like those in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., would be less deadly. If you have a permit to carry a concealed weapon, he wants to make it valid in all 50 states, as simple as a driver's license. And Mr. Trump himself has a permit to carry a concealed handgun, which he is not shy about mentioning. "Somebody attacks me, oh, they're gonna be shocked," he warned last year. Mr. Trump, who promises to "totally protect" the Second Amendment, is scheduled to speak on Friday at the annual convention of the National Rifle Association, on the cusp of a general election in which gun issues are expected to be more prominent than in recent presidential races. His address should signal how far he is likely to go in pressing gun rights to energize the Republican base in the fall campaign.

Clinton Calls Democratic Race 'Done,' Says Trump Unqualified&lt;http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-19/clinton-says-democratic-race-already-done-trump-unqualified&gt;

BLOOMBERG POLITICS // MARGARET TALEV

Hillary Clinton essentially declared the Democratic nomination race over, moving to quash concerns about an uprising by Bernie Sanders's supporters and refocus Democrats on defeating Republican Donald Trump, who she called unqualified to hold the nation's highest office. "I will be the nominee for my party," the former secretary of state said in an interview with CNN on Thursday. "That is already done. There is no way I won't be." Asked whether she believes presumptive Republican nominee Trump is qualified to be president, Clinton said, "No, I do not." Sanders's campaign responded by saying voters have "growing doubts" about Clinton. Trump issued a statement saying: "She has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as president at this delicate and difficult time in our country's history."

Hillary Clinton on Thursday said there is "no way" that she will not be the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016, and that Bernie Sanders would do well to unify behind her as the party's standard-bearer against Donald Trump "I will be the nominee for my party, Chris," the former secretary of state told CNN's Chris Cuomo in an interview from Park Ridge, Illinois. "That is already done, in effect. There's no way that I won't be." As for Bernie Sanders, Clinton said "he has to do his part to unify." "He said the other day that he'll do everything possible to defeat Donald Trump. He said he'd work seven days a week. I take him at his word," Clinton said. "I think the threat that Donald Trump poses is so dramatic to our country, to our democracy and our economy that I certainly expect Sen. Sanders to do what he said he would." Clinton dodged a question from Cuomo on whether she would choose Sanders as her running mate.

WALL STREET JOURNAL // TIM HANRAHAN AND LAURA MECKLER

Hillary Clinton said the Democratic presidential race is effectively over and "there is no way" she won't be the party's nominee. In an interview with CNN Thursday, Mrs. Clinton also said that she is confident the party will unify ahead of the general election, despite rival Bernie Sanders's pledge to keep fighting until the summer convention. In recent weeks, Mrs. Clinton has pivoted away from the primary battle, where she holds a large delegate lead, and toward the general election and presumptive GOP opponent Donald Trump. "I will be the nominee for my party," she told CNN Thursday. "That is already done, in effect. There is no way that I won't be." Mrs. Clinton was asked if she believed Mr Trump is qualified to be president. "No, I do not," she said, and cited his recent comments on British leaders, NATO and North Korea. Based on his comments and policies, "I think it adds up to a very troubling picture," Mrs. Clinton said. When asked about the anger from Mr. Sanders and his supporters, she said, "I have every confidence we're going to be unified."

Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton pivoted to a general election match-up against Republican candidate Donald Trump on Thursday, saying he is dangerously unpredictable and not qualified to be president. Confident that she is finally close to defeating U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the Democratic nomination, Clinton turned heavy fire on Trump, who has been running about even with her in national polls of voters looking ahead to the Nov. 8 presidential election. On the Republican side, Trump promoted top aide Paul Manafort to serve as campaign manager and chief strategist, the Trump campaign said. Corey Lewandowski, the Trump aide who has been campaign manager, retains that title and will continue to oversee day-to-day operations, the campaign said. In addition, Trump has hired veteran Republican lawyer A.B. Culvahouse to help vet potential vice presidential running mates, a source close to the campaign said.

WASHINGTON POST // CHRIS CILLIZZA

Hillary Clinton has been waiting (relatively) patiently for Bernie Sanders to recognize the mathematical and political realities of his current situation and either end his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination or heavily scale back the rhetoric he has been using against her. He has done neither. And in an interview Thursday with CNN, Clinton made clear that she's had enough. Here's the key piece of what she said to CNN's Chris Cuomo: "I went all the way to the end against then-Senator Obama. I won nine out of the last 12 contests back in '08. I won Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia. So I know the intense feelings that arise, particularly among your supporters as you go toward the end. But we both were following the same rules just as both Senator Sanders and I are following the same rules, and I'm 3 million votes ahead of him and I have an insurmountable lead in pledge delegates and I'm confident that just as I did with Senator Obama, where I said, you know what? It was really close. Much closer. Much closer than it is between me and Senator Sanders right now."

POLITICO // ALEX ISENSTADT

The Never Trump moment is over. While a small group of Republicans has wrung its hands raw over the choice between the GOP's nominee and Hillary Clinton, the party's firmament - social and intellectual conservatives, the lobbyist and donor class, powerful operatives and outside groups - is increasingly getting in line behind Donald Trump. Never mind that many of them complain about his bombastic and unpredictable political style. The thawing has slowly but surely begun - and it's visible everywhere -- from mega-donors like Foster Friess rallying Republican governors to Trump, to Mitt Romney's allies agreeing to raise money for him, to leaders of the Never Trump movement conceding their cause is lost.

Republicans Want Their Party to Unify Behind Donald Trump, Poll Shows&lt;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-poll.html?ref=politics&gt;

NEW YORK TIMES // JONATHAN MARTIN AND DALIA SUSSMAN

An overwhelming majority of Republican voters say their party's leaders should get behind Donald J. Trump, even as he enters the general election saddled with toxic favorability ratings among the broader electorate, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. And as Mr. Trump faces deep skepticism with general election voters and some Republican holdouts, the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, is grappling with Senator Bernie Sanders and how to win over his impassioned supporters. Both parties thus approach their July nominating conventions with significant unease and hurdles to overcome. Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton are widely disliked by voters, and both parties will need to repair schisms that might spell doom in an ordinary election year. But this, of course, is no ordinary year.

Paul Manafort, the veteran strategist who joined Donald Trump's campaign two months ago to wrangle convention delegates, was given a new title on Thursday: campaign chairman and chief strategist. Manafort, who has decades of political experience in the United States and overseas, will continue to help the campaign prepare for the Republican convention in July but he will primarily focus on gearing up the general election, according to campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks. Trump's longtime campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, will continue in that role and continue to oversee many day-to-day campaign operations.

POLITICO // BUGRESS EVERETT SEUNG MIN KIM AND ELI STOKOLS

Donald Trump's newly empowered chief strategist sought to convince top GOP congressional officials on Capitol Hill that Trump can compete for the Latino vote, exploit Hillary Clinton's weaknesses and become a Reagan-esque figure in the party, according to attendees and sources familiar with the meeting. After Trump himself attempted to sooth House and Senate Republican leaders over how the presumptive nominee will conduct his campaign and work to keep Congress in GOP control, it was Paul Manafort's turn on Thursday to try and win over some of the top GOP operatives in the party. Facing a room full of seasoned campaign veterans and longtime congressional aides at D.C. law firm Jones day on Capitol Hill, Manafort struck a confident tone. He told attendees that Ronald Reagan used to be criticized just like Trump is now for his polarizing reputation within the Republican Party, the sources said. And the senior Trump adviser said the campaign will work hard to court Latinos, despite Trump's poor approval ratings among Hispanics and Trump's controversial comments about Mexican immigrants, said one attendee. Though Manafort has joined the campaign to bring an extra layer of seasoning to an operation filled with fresh-faced Republican operatives, he insisted that his power is limited: Trump, he said in so many words, is going to be Trump.

WASHINGTON POST // REBECCA SINDERBRAND

Forget the headlines - Donald Trump is having a very good month. This isn't just because his businesses may be seeing a campaign-year boost, or because Democrats have currently wrested the title of "Party Most Likely To Experience Arrests On the Convention Floor" away from the GOP. At this point in the year, when presumptive nominees tend to take a bit of a break from the road, the campaign action is largely defined by moves you can't capture on camera. And right now, Donald Trump appears to be making the right ones. Today, Chris Cillizza took a closer look at a few of them.

WALL STREET JOURNAL // NIEL KING JR. AND AARON ZITNER

Elections are always a game of positives versus negatives. If you're the candidate, you do your best to talk yourself up and your opponent down. This year's presidential brawl will test the depths of those downs and-very likely-the limits of both front-runner's efforts to go up. In the battle over image, the two likely presidential nominees face a challenge not seen in modern history. No modern candidate has entered the fray at this point of the race with deeper negatives than either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. And if history is any guide, their room for improvement is scant, especially because of their nearly 100% name recognition. In the most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, those holding a negative view of Mrs. Clinton exceeded those who held a positive view by 24 percentage points. It was even worse for Mr. Trump, who came in 41 points underwater.

Exclusive: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes, tied to Trump and his companies&lt;http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/05/19/trumps-tax-troubles/84543538/&gt;

USA TODAY // NICK PENZENSTADLER AND DAVID WILSON

While Donald J. Trump refuses to release his federal tax returns, saying his tax rate is "none of your business," a USA TODAY analysis found Trump's businesses have been involved in at least 100 lawsuits and other disputes related to unpaid taxes or how much tax his businesses owe. Trump's companies have been engaged in battles over taxes almost every year from the late 1980s until as recently as March, the analysis of court cases, property records, and other documents across the country shows. At least five Trump companies were issued warrants totaling more than $13,000 for late or unpaid taxes in New York state just since Trump declared his candidacy in June 2015, according to state records. This spring, as Trump flew to campaign rallies around the country aboard his trademark private jet, the state of New York filed a tax warrant to try to collect $8,578 in unpaid taxes from the Trump-owned company that owns the Boeing 757. The company has since paid that tax bill. As recently as last week, Trump said he was "willing to pay more" taxes personally and that "taxes for the rich will go up somewhat" if he becomes president. But the lawsuits and other tax-related disputes show a different reality for his businesses.

A Maryland man who is a delegate for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been indicted for illegally shipping explosives, owning a machine gun and producing child pornography, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday. Caleb Bailey, 30, was indicted by a grand jury in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Wednesday. He was elected to be a delegate for Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, and is still listed as one on the state's board of elections website. Joe Cluster, executive director of the Maryland Republican Party, confirmed Bailey had been indicted and told Reuters the party was asking Bailey to resign from the delegation. "I don't know too much about him beyond what I've read," said Cluster, who declined to comment further. Bailey had hundreds of illegal weapons stored in a bunker beneath his garage, including dozens of machine guns, smokeless grenades and gas canisters, along with ready-to-eat meals, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation.

Sen. John Cornyn is a personal acquaintance of Don Willett, one of the people on Donald Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees: Both men share the distinction of having served on Texas' highest court. Another Trump favorite, Thomas Lee, is the brother of Utah Sen. Mike Lee. Colorado Supreme Court Justice Allison Eid was once Sen. Cory Gardner's law professor. And Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley was so pleased with an Iowa judge included on Trump's list that the senator said he would've personally recommended Steven Colloton to a future president considering a high court justice. In selecting names for his list of potential Supreme Court picks, Trump seemed to make direct appeals to Senate Republicans by choosing their associates and even relatives, along with jurists who have long been household names among conservatives. Willett - a colorful and prolific Twitter user who now serves on the Texas Supreme Court - knows Cornyn well, the No. 2 Senate Republican said on Thursday. The two men didn't serve at the same time, but Cornyn called him a "good man" and "kind of a unique guy."

A "super PAC" supporting Donald J.

The group, Great America PAC, released a list of names that included the former actress and conservative pundit Stacey Dash, the New York businessman Robert Lapidus and the petroleum executive James Volker. The group is one of at least four potential super PACs in the works to support Mr. Trump. Stanley Hubbard, a businessman who signed up with the group in the last few weeks, said in a statement that it was imperative to continue trying to amass support for Mr. Trump. The supporters' list was intended to show a broad range of regional support around the country.

Great America PAC, a super PAC backing presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump, is stacking its donor ranks, rolling out a new list of wealthy backers as it seeks to solidify its status as the primary outside group backing the New York businessman. Investor Yuri Vanetik and TD Service Financial Corp. founder Dale Dykema, who each bundled up to $100,000 for 2008 GOP nominee John McCain, are among the new donors backing the super PAC, according to a list of "top-level supporters" provided by the group. Clean Energy Fuels chief executive Andrew Littlefair and William Reid, the former chairman of Gold Resource Corporation who gave $30,000 to a super PAC backing 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, have also pledged to donate to the super PAC. Augusta Petrone, the wife of Ambassador Joseph Petrone who served as an honorary New Hampshire co-chairwoman for Rudy Giuliani's 2008 presidential campaign, and Stacey Dash, a conservative commentator and actress best known for her role in the film "Clueless," are also on the list.

Ever since Gov. Chris Christie dropped out of the Republican presidential race and backed Donald Trump, he has taken quite a beating while helping the man he calls "Mr. Trump" try to win the White House. Now, after months of kowtowing to Trump, the roles were reversed - if only for a few hours. Trump appeared at a fundraiser here Thursday night to help retire the debt Christie still carries from his failed presidential campaign. The two men appeared at a National Guard armory outfitted with chandeliers, where people paid $200 to get in the door and help Christie pay down about $400,000 in campaign obligations - though some said they got in for free. Trump also appeared at a $25,000-per-head event to help fill the coffers of the New Jersey Republican Party.

Stealing From Ebola to Fight Zika&lt;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/opinion/stealing-from-ebola-to-fight-zika.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&gt;

NEW YORK TIMES // THE EDITORIAL BOARD

Nobody should be surprised when the present House of Representatives, dominated by penurious reactionaries, produces a stingy response to a danger that calls for compassionate largess. But for sheer fecklessness it's hard to top the House's response this week to the Zika virus. The salient feature is that in providing money to fight one health menace, it steals from other funds meant to fight an even more dangerous threat - the Ebola virus. In February, President Obama asked Congress for $1.9 billion to help fight Zika, a virus that can cause severe birth defects and has been linked to neurological disorders in adults. Transmittable by mosquitoes and through sex, Zika broke out last year in Brazil and has since spread to the United States and other countries. Experts fear there could eventually be hundreds of thousands of infections in Puerto Rico, where nearly half the population lives below the poverty line, with possibly hundreds of babies affected. States in the American South with large mosquito populations are also at particular risk. On Thursday, the Senate voted for $1.1 billion in emergency funds for research, vaccine development, mosquito control efforts and other programs. The bill does not provide as much money as public health agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say they need, but it is a decent start.

Overdue change in overtime pay: Our view&lt;http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/05/19/overtime-pay-labor-department-obama-editorials-debates/84615984/&gt;

USA TODAY // THE EDITORIAL BOARD

For most people, a salaried job paying $25,000 a year is far from exceptional. It corresponds to an hourly wage of roughly $14, which isn't enough to live on in many pricey metro areas. But, according to existing federal labor rules, a $25,000 job can be classified as managerial or given another designation that exempts it from overtime pay. That's why the Obama administration moved this week to change those rules. As of Dec. 1, the minimum annual salary that can be excluded from overtime will be raised from $23,660 to $47,476, unless opponents manage to block the change in Congress or the courts. The move is long overdue. The percentage of people eligible for overtime has been in a free fall since its high in 1975. Then, 62% of salaried workers were paid overtime for work over 40 hours. Today the number is 7%. And it was even lower before 2004, when the Bush administration made some needed changes.

Much-needed relief for debt-ridden Puerto Rico&lt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/much-needed-relief-for-debt-ridden-puerto-rico/2016/05/19/1499319e-1de1-11e6-8c7b-6931e66333e7_story.html&gt;

WASHINGTON POST // THE EDITORIAL BOARD

IN A badly broken Washington, even small victories for normal governmental process count as cause for celebration. Consider Thursday's agreement between House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and the Obama administration on a measure to help Puerto Rico out of its debt crisis. The need for legislation is obvious and urgent, given Puerto Rico's insolvency, its $2 billion debt payment due in July and the lack of any bankruptcy-like mechanism for resolving the situation under existing law. That's why Mr. Ryan had set a March 31 deadline for action by the House - only to be thwarted by an effective, but not very transparent, lobbying effort led by hedge funds with an interest in blocking restructuring of Puerto Rican bonds they bought at fire-sale prices. Taking to the airwaves with hyperbolic warnings of an impending taxpayer "bailout," these interests helped distort and delay House work on a bill, pushing Puerto Rico and its beleaguered populace right to the edge of financial collapse - and a possible humanitarian crisis.

Republicans' stunningly illogical attempt to end the District's budget autonomy&lt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-stunningly-illogical-attempt-to-end-the-districts-budget-autonomy/2016/05/19/750d0cc4-1d2f-11e6-8c7b-6931e66333e7_story.html&gt;

WASHINGTON POST // THE EDITORIAL BOARD

IN THEIR push to repeal a measure giving D.C. the right to spend its own tax dollars, House Republicans repeatedly sounded the argument that the Constitution gives Congress "supreme authority" over the District. They are right about that power. But that doesn't answer why a party that professes to champion local control and abhor government overreach would choose to undermine self-government in an American city that is home to 700,000 people. The illogic, even by Washington standards, is stunning. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted along party lines this week to advance a bill that would nullify budget autonomy for the District. D.C. voters overwhelmingly approved budget autonomy in a 2013 referendum. The measure, though subject to differing legal interpretations, has been upheld in court. Moreover, before it went into effect, Congress had an opportunity to overturn it but instead chose not to act.
