		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://www.torproject.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://www.torproject.org/'" tppabs="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://tails.boum.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://tails.boum.org/'" tppabs="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://tails.boum.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://tails.boum.org/'" tppabs="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://www.couragefound.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://www.couragefound.org/'" tppabs="https://www.couragefound.org/">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<div class="onion-url">wlupld3ptjvsgwqw.onion</div>
			<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

All this week, Democrats across the country have shown that from now until November 8th we're going to hold Republicans up and down the ballot accountable for their divisive and dangerous standard bearer, Donald Trump. Below is a sampling of the coverage:

REPUBLICAN KASICH ASSESSES FUTURE AFTER CRUZ DROPS OUT&lt;http://www.newsweek.com/republican-kasich-assesses-future-after-cruz-drops-out-455589&gt;
NEWSWEEK // MICHELE GORMAN
Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper on Wednesday issued a statement criticizing Governor Kasich for traveling out of the state for more than 200 days during his presidential campaign. He listed issues that need to be dealt with in the state, including job growth that has trailed the national average, a public school system that has plummeted from fifth to 23rd in the country and more children living in poverty now than during the height of the recession in 2008.

"It's time that Ohio had a governor who was actually doing something about all of that, rather than gallivanting across the country," Pepper said. "We hope that the Kasich administration will provide a full accounting of the cost to Ohio taxpayers and Kasich's campaign will reimburse the state for every single penny that his failed campaign cost the taxpayers of Ohio."

Nevada Democratic Party hopes Trump will be 'albatross' for down-ballot Republicans&lt;http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/05/nevada-democrats-trump-down-ballot-222799&gt;
POLITICO // BRIANNA GURCIULLO
As political leaders across the ideological spectrum weighed in Wednesday on a Donald Trump-Hillary Clinton match-up, the Nevada State Democratic Party had a snarkier take.

In a letter to "Dangerous Donald," Chair Roberta Lange congratulated Trump on his victory in Indiana on Tuesday, which led to Ted Cruz and John Kasich suspending their campaigns. And Lange invited Trump to "come back to Nevada as soon as possible."

"Nevada will be a key battleground up and down the ballot in 2016," Lange wrote. "But we're eager to see just how big of an albatross you can be for down-ballot Republicans."

The chair added: "And we know for a fact your racist, misogynistic, anti-immigrant rhetoric will inspire even more of our supporters to get involved and elect Democrats."

Many Nevada Republicans get behind Trump as nominee
&lt;http://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2016/05/04/many-nevada-republicans-get-behind-trump-nominee/83951220/&gt;RENO GAZETTE JOURNAL // SETH A. RICHARDSON
The overall support from Republican candidates comes as Democrats released a flurry of criticisms against Trump aimed at courting voters in the general election. The Clinton campaign released a statement calling Trump a bully while Nevada Democratic Party Chairwoman Roberta Lange released a letter - referring to Trump as "Dangerous Donald" - stating an eagerness "to see just how big of an albatross" Trump will be in the state races.

"Unlike the Republicans, Democrats are actually going to hold you accountable," Lange said in the letter. "And we know for a fact your racist, misogynistic, anti-immigrant rhetoric will inspire even more of our supporters to get involved and elect Democrats."
...

Plus, Hansen said, the Democrats have problems of their own with a still-contested primary between Clinton and Sanders.

"I think if you end up with Hillary for the Democrats and Trump for the Republicans, I think Hillary will actually suppress the base vote of the Democratic Party," Hansen said. "The younger people who have been supporting Bernie Sanders will not be very enthusiastic about her. And I think Trump will have a substantial crossover."

Trump's looming nomination poses problem for GOP candidates in Nevada&lt;http://www.reviewjournal.com/politics/elections/trump-s-looming-nomination-poses-problem-gop-candidates-nevada&gt;
LAS VEGAS REVIEW JOURNAL
The Nevada State Democratic Party reacted with a tongue-in-cheek letter inviting Trump to the state. Signed by state party Chairwoman Roberta Lange, the letter to Trump highlighted Nevada's role as a battleground state, including congressional races and the open Senate seat that Reid is vacating. Lange wrote that Democrats are in "strong position to win" those races, adding, "But we're eager to see just how big of an albatross you can be for down-ballot Republicans." Pointing to prominent GOP candidates supporting Trump, including Heck and Hardy, Lange wrote: "So Nevada Republicans are sure to welcome you here with open arms." She added: "Unlike the Republicans, Democrats are actually going to hold you accountable. And we know for a fact your racist, misogynistic, anti-immigrant rhetoric will inspire even more of our supporters to get involved and elect Democrats."

Some still resist, but many Republicans come to terms with their new reality: It's Trump&lt;http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-trump-gop-nominee-20160504-snap-story.html&gt;
LOS ANGELES TIMES // MARK Z. BARABAL AND LISA MASCARO
There are a few Democratic-leaning states he might make more competitive, such as Pennsylvania, with its large population of disaffected working-class whites. But there are others that have been reliably Republican, like Arizona and Georgia, that could come into play if Latinos and other minorities, antagonized by Trump's insults, turn out in high numbers.

In Nevada, a major battleground in the last few elections, the state Democratic Party sent a taunting letter Wednesday urging Trump - "Dear Dangerous Donald" - to campaign there, figuring it would hurt his candidacy and other Republicans as well.

"General election," wrote Nevada Democratic Party Chairwoman Roberta Lange, "here we go!"

Ohio Democrats happy about Trump as presumptive GOP nominee
&lt;http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article75819237.html&gt;AP // DAN SEWELL
Ohio Democrats are happy for businessman Donald Trump - that is, happy for the prospect of the brash presumptive Republican presidential nominee topping the opposition ticket in November.

Party Chairman David Pepper said Thursday that Democrats are preparing for a tough campaign in the swing state, but think Trump could lift turnout for Democrats while complicating other Republicans' campaigns.

"Every candidate will have to win their own race, but I think the broader environment is one that puts people like (U.S. Sen.) Rob Portman in a very difficult position, not just because I think a lot of Republicans will be torn about the top of the ticket; I also think the tone that Donald Trump is setting makes it very hard," Pepper said.

As Pepper spoke, an aide held up a poster with a large Portman photo with a smaller one of Trump calling on him to "denounce Trump."

Portman had hoped Ohio Gov. John Kasich would be the nominee. After Kasich bowed out Wednesday, Portman's campaign reiterated he intends to support the GOP nominee as he battles for re-election against Democratic former Gov. Ted Strickland. Strickland campaign spokesman David Bergstein says Trump's nomination will be Portman's "election nightmare.
...

Democrat state Rep. Denise Driehaus, running for Hamilton County commissioner, and Aftab Pureval, an attorney of Asian descent running for county clerk of courts, joined Pepper and said Trump's insulting comments about women and immigrants will hang over other Republicans.

WMUR 9 // JOHN DISTASO
A state Democratic Party that's feeling pretty good about its chances in November will roll out a memo on Thursday tying Trump to Ayotte and the four GOP candidates for governor.

Surprise! It predicts disaster for the GOP candidates in New Hampshire.

The memo cites reports that split ticket voting is not as prevalent as it once was and polling numbers, including a recent WMUR Granite State Poll, which showed Trump losing the state to either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.

The memo predicts that Republicans will try to distance themselves from Trump, but that it will be a failed strategy.

"The numbers tell a different tale," the memo says. "They say that come November, Trump's candidacy will be a disaster for whoever emerges as the Republican gubernatorial candidate, for Sen. Ayotte and for the rest of New Hampshire Republicans."

State GOP: Rally for Trump or run for the hills - or Hillary?&lt;http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/state-gop-divided-over-trumps-triumph/&gt;
SEATTLE TIMES // JIM BRUNNER
The top-of-the-ticket problem for Washington Republicans is not new. The state hasn't favored a Republican presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Democrats are already working to tie all GOP candidates to the party's presidential nominee. "The Republican Party is now officially the party of Trump," state Democratic Party chair Jaxon Ravens said in a statement, trashing Trump's "hateful and dangerous remarks about women, Hispanics, and Muslims."

"He's gone after and insulted group after group," North Carolina Democratic Party spokesman Dave Miranda said. "There is a lot of division now within the GOP, and Trump sort of exemplifies that."

VT DIGGER // JASPER CRAVEN
Leaders in the Vermont Democratic Party have been prepping for a Trump candidacy for months and will likely work to link every controversial Trumpism to Vermont Republicans as the election approaches. "The Republican Party has all but officially nominated a man for president who has created a campaign out of fear and hatred," said Vermont Democratic spokeswoman Christina Amestoy in a statement Wednesday. "... His blatant disregard for civil liberties, his promotion of violence, and his horrifying language directed at women and minorities cannot be taken lightly and must be stopped."

As GOP divisions grow, Martinez remains silent on Trump endorsement&lt;http://www.taosnews.com/article_bcf7b628-12fe-11e6-a05e-e7a29ced5031.html&gt;
TAOS NEWS // STEVE TERRELL
In a statement Tuesday night, New Mexico Democratic Party Chairwoman Debra Haaland said, "Gov. Martinez can't hide from reporters much longer - New Mexicans deserve an honest answer on whether our governor will stand with Donald Trump and his offensive remarks and reckless policy positions now that he has a clear path to the nomination." Though Martinez didn't initially announce her intentions, the state Republican Party, echoing the sentiments expressed by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, issued a statement shortly after the Indiana results were in.

In New Mexico, Democrats and GOP scrutinize Trump&lt;http://krqe.com/2016/05/05/in-new-mexico-democrats-and-gop-scrutinize-trump/&gt;
KRQE NEWS // AP
Leading Democrats in New Mexico are taking aim at Donald Trump as the state's Republican governor withholds her full endorsement of the presumptive GOP nominee. State Democratic lawmakers and party leaders gathered at an outdoor plaza Thursday in Albuquerque to highlight a disconnect they see between Trump's candidacy and New Mexico values. Both major parties are reaching out to constituents days before a registration deadline to vote in New Mexico's June 7 primary election. Republican Gov. Susana Martinez won't indicate yet whether she will vote for Trump and says she first wants to hear how he plans to support national weapons laboratories and military bases in the state. State Democratic Chairwoman Debra Haaland says Trump is unqualified and needs to be pressed on issues such as immigration and income inequality.

Arkansas GOP says loyal will sign on to Trump bid&lt;http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2016/may/05/state-gop-says-loyal-will-sign-on-20160/#/&gt;
ARKANSAS ONLINE // FRANK LOCKWOOD
A Democratic Party of Arkansas official said it's too early to say how Trump's nomination would play out in Arkansas. "We're in uncharted territory right now," said party spokesman H.L. Moody. "What was funny yesterday is no longer a joke, and no one is laughing today." Trump's ascendancy is cause for concern, he said. "This guy is the most dangerous person who the Republican Party could possibly nominate. He doesn't have the knowledge or the experience or the worldview to be the commander in chief," Moody said.

WRAL // LAURA LESLIE
With so many of Trump's comments recorded on video or social media and heavily reported by the press, state Democratic Party spokesman David Miranda said the rebranding of the Republican front-runner is likely to be difficult. "We've seen him over the course of this debate divide the country, insulting the disabled, African-Americans, Latinos, women repeatedly - any group, name it," Miranda said. "Trump has divided us as a country, and that's not what we need. We need someone who can bring us together."
...

Current national poll averages show Clinton ahead of Trump. Still, Miranda said, Democrats believe Trump would be a "disastrous" president and will work hard to make sure he doesn't occupy the Oval Office. "We're not taking anything for granted. Republicans took Donald Trump for granted, and now he's the nominee," Miranda said. "We think he is a very serious threat to the country. So, we're going to work hard for every vote, and we're hopeful that, if we do the work, we can win here in North Carolina and around the country, up and down the ticket."

Democrats set to unload $91 million in attacks on Donald Trump&lt;http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2016/05/06/democrats-set-to-unload-91-million-in-attacks-on-donald-trump/&gt;
ATLANTA JOURNAL CONSTITUTION // GREG BLUESTEIN AND JIM GALLOWAY
Georgia Democrats are attempting to do their part, by tying the new GOP standard-bearer. Noting our Thursday piece about Republican statewide officials closing ranks around the billionaire, state Democratic party chair DuBose Porter expressed horror at the "shocking embrace" of Donald Trump. Said Porter:"Donald Trump may be the most dangerous presidential candidate of our lifetime and the ruling class of the Georgia GOP seems perfectly fine with the impending chaos of a potential-yet improbable-Trump presidency. How on Earth could Johnny Isakson, David Perdue and the rest of that crew trust a volatile, divisive figure to lead the greatest armed forces in the World? How can they sleep at night with the looming prospect of Donald Trump being in possession of nuclear codes?"

As Trump's path clears, Virginia Republicans react tepidly to likely nominee&lt;http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/article_35e71512-94e9-5014-945c-2a5a84f0417b.html&gt;
RICHMOND TIMES DISPATCH // GRAHAM MOOMAW AND JIM NOLAN
....

Virginia Democrats wasted little time rousing supporters after Trump emerged victorious. The first anti-Trump fundraising appeal went out immediately after Cruz withdrew. In a statement, Democratic Party of Virginia Chairwoman Susan Swecker called Trump "the most dangerous person who has ever been nominated by a national party." "His policies would drive our economy into ruin, subvert the status of women in the United States, and cause irreparable damage to the international world order," Swecker said. "Donald Trump is dangerous, he is not fit to be president, and Democrats are united to defeat him."

How do area politicians feel about Trump?&lt;http://www.heraldcourier.com/news/local/how-do-area-politicians-feel-about-trump/article_583bf5d5-aacb-5bb3-a9fa-c1a2530b999c.html&gt;
BRISTOL HERALD COURIER // ROBERT SORRELL
Susan Swecker, chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, issued a statement after Trump became the likely nominee. "Donald Trump is the most dangerous person who has ever been nominated by a national party," Swecker said. "He cannot be trusted with our military, nuclear weapons and diplomatic relations. Donald Trump is not suited to be commander in chief of the United States of America. His policies would drive our economy into ruin, subvert the status of women in the United States, and cause irreparable damage to the international world order." She added that Trump is "dangerous, not fit to be president and Democrats are united to defeat him." In Tennessee, state Democratic Party Chairwoman Mary Mancini also said Trump is dangerous. "Donald Trump has built his campaign on fear, stoking the embers of racism, sexism, and xenophobia that still remain in this country, but that hasn't stopped the Tennessee Republicans from endorsing and actively campaigning for him," Mancini said.

Gillespie and Wittman, candidates for Va. governor, say they will support Trump&lt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/gillespie-and-wittman-candidates-for-va-governor-say-they-will-support-trump/2016/05/04/84502ad4-1246-11e6-8967-7ac733c56f12_story.html&gt;
WASHINGTON POST // LAURA VOZZELLA
Democrats pounced, issuing a statement that sought to link Gillespie to some of Trump's most controversial comments. (Wittman's statement came after the Democrats sent out their release, so it needled him only for remaining "silent.") "With Gillespie's newfound support of Trump, Virginians are left with several questions: Does Gillespie support Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border?," the Democratic Party of Virginia said in its release. "Does Gillespie agree with Donald Trump that women should be punished for seeking abortions? Does Gillespie agree with Donald Trump that Islam hates America and that Muslims should be banned from traveling to the United States?"

State Democrats Say Trump Nomination is a Gift&lt;http://www.courant.com/politics/hc-democrats-congress-nominate-20160506-story.html&gt;
HARTFORD COURANT // RUSSELL BLAIR
The state Democratic Party will nominate six incumbents as it looks to maintain control over Connecticut's delegation in Washington. And right now, the Democrats like what they see on the political horizon. Nick Balletto, chairman of the party, said he thinks the slate will do well against a Republican ticket led by Donald Trump, the presumptive presidential nominee. He said Trump's extremist views are out of step with Connecticut voters. "For us I think the best thing in the world is Trump at the top of the Republican ticket," Balletto said. Balletto said Republicans are "in their own little universe," and recalled a bumper sticker he had recently seen - "Democratic Party: We're not perfect, but they're nuts."

Iowa GOP prepares for Trump-led general election&lt;http://qctimes.com/news/local/government-and-politics/elections/iowa-gop-prepares-for-trump-led-general-election/article_cdb420c3-8bfc-5fc1-999e-f0fb7fe1b3cf.html&gt;

...
Already, Democrats were targeting that demographic. In a statement Wednesday afternoon from the Iowa Democratic Party, Chair Andy McGuire said Trump "oozes with misogyny and his treatment of women as objects is deplorable." Kaufmann said Trump needs to "explain himself" and point to the women he has hired in his organization. "There's a difference between a tweet that might be considered rude and how you feel about a particular set of individuals," he said.

Democrats attack Gov. Larry Hogan, say he's silently endorsing Trump&lt;http://www.wbaltv.com/politics/democrats-attack-gov-larry-hogan-say-hes-silently-endorsing-trump/39399760&gt;
WBALTV // DAVID COLLINS
The national Democratic Governors Association is going after Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, accusing him of silently supporting presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.
...

But local and national Democrats say that's not enough. They said by failing to speak out and declaring Trump a danger to his party, the state and the country, Hogan is helping him.

"Absolutely, it is a silent endorsement. By doing nothing, he caused the outcome," said Patrick Murray, executive director of the Maryland state Democratic Party. "Frankly, Larry Hogan had ample opportunity to convince Maryland Republicans that Donald Trump is dangerous for our state and our country. He didn't take those opportunities."

The criticism came as Trump began the process of selecting a running mate and uniting the party

On the other side of the political coin, Democratic Party Chair Joe McNamara said he believes both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders would beat Trump in November, but he still expressed fear at the thought of him in the Oval Office. "The possibility that he could be president is horrifying," said Rep. McNamara. "Some of his statements he has made are so outrageous. They just highlight the fact that the world would be a much more dangerous place." McNamara referenced Trump's plan to stop muslim immigration, and his support for the use of torture. "Look at the big picture," Trillo said. "Don't zero in on these small little things that are politically incorrect." Trillo said he believes Trump could win Rhode Island in November, but the numbers from last week's Rhode Island primary indicate it's still a blue state. "Hillary Clinton lost, and got more votes than the entire GOP field," said McNamara. About 52,700 Rhode Islanders voted for Clinton in the primary, compared to about 39,200 for Trump. Bernie Sanders won the most votes, at nearly 67,000.

Texas GOP Starts to Rally Behind Trump as Nominee&lt;https://www.texastribune.org/2016/05/04/texas-gop-begins-to-accept-trump-as-nominee/&gt;

...
Texas Democrats, meanwhile, declared the rival party dead as soon as it became clear Trump was the presumptive nominee. "This is now Donald Trump's Republican Party," deputy executive director Manny Garcia said in a statement that also suggested Texas Republicans were only reaping what they sowed after spending years creating an "environment for someone like Donald Trump to thrive."

"Texas Republicans are split on Trump, but the reality is they only have themselves to blame," Garcia continued. "Donald Trump is now the face and voice of Republicans."

In New Mexico, Democrats and GOP scrutinize Trump&lt;http://www.kob.com/politics-news/in-new-mexico-democrats-and-gop-scrutinize-donald-trump/4128344/?cat=500#.VyzcZISDGkq&gt;
ASSOCIATED PRESS
Leading Democrats in New Mexico are taking aim at Donald Trump as the state's Republican governor withholds her full endorsement of the presumptive GOP nominee. State Democratic lawmakers and party leaders gathered at an outdoor plaza Thursday in Albuquerque to highlight a disconnect they see between Trump's candidacy and New Mexico values. Both major parties are reaching out to constituents days before a registration deadline to vote in New Mexico's June 7 primary election. Republican Gov. Susana Martinez won't indicate yet whether she will vote for Trump and says she first wants to hear how he plans to support national weapons laboratories and military bases in the state. State Democratic Chairwoman Debra Haaland says Trump is unqualified and needs to be pressed on issues such as immigration and income inequality.

ALLISON TANT: 'DONALD TRUMP IS THE MOST DANGEROUS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN LIVING MEMORY&lt;http://floridapolitics.com/archives/208770-allison-tant-donald-trump-dangerous-presidential-candidate-living-memory&gt;
FLORIDA POLITICS //
The chair of the Florida Democratic Party is scolding Republican candidates for supporting Donald Trump as the Republican nominee. "Donald Trump is the most dangerous presidential candidate in living memory, and every Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Florida believes he has passed the commander-in-chief test," said Allison Tant in a statement. "Their willingness to turn over the most powerful military in the world to a pathological liar with poor impulse control disqualifies them from serving the people of Florida in the Senate."
....

On Thursday, the state Democratic Party said the support for Trump will be remembered when voters head to the polls this year."Floridians from all walks of life who have been targets of Trump's racism, sexism, and xenophobia will remember in November," said Tant in a statement.

Democrats tie Trump to GOP Senate candidates&lt;http://www.kcci.com/politics/democrats-tie-trump-to-gop-senate-candidates/39386448&gt;
CNN // TED BARRETT
The Pennsylvania Democratic Party targeted Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, who is seeking his second term in what is expected to be a close race against Democrat Katie McGinty, with a series of questions aimed to tying Toomey to Trump."Does Toomey think Donald Trump is qualified to nominate the next Supreme Court justice?" the statement asked. "How does Toomey square his support of Trump with the presidential nominee's belief that 'wages are too high' in America?" Toomey initially endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, for president. After Rubio dropped out, Toomey voted for Cruz in the Pennsylvania primary. But like so many Republican elected officials, even those wary of Trump, he has said he will also back whoever wins the nomination.
